Mr. Hynde Is Out of His Mind

Chapter One
Boring, Snoring Mr. Loring
My name is A.J. and I hate school.
I hate reading.
I hate writing.
I hate arithmetic.
But there’s one horrible subject that I
really hate more than anything else.
Music.
Music is so dumb! Music is the most
boring subject in the history of the world.
Why do we need music class in school,
anyway? It’s not like I’m going to grow up
to be a singer. When I grow up, I’m going
to be a professional dirt bike racer.
In first grade last year, the music
teacher, Mr. Loring, made us sing all
these totally corny songs from prehistoric
times, like “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”
and “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore.” Mr.
Loring loves boats, I guess. He’s weird.
He’s about a million hundred years old,
and he has long gray hair. Mr. Loring told
us that when he was a kid back in the last
century, TV wasn’t even invented yet.
Can you imagine living in a world with-out TV? It must have been horrible! I
would die if I didn’t have TV.
Mr. Loring’s favorite song for us to sing
was “Who Stole the Cookie from the
Cookie Jar?” You know the song:
Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?
A.J. stole the cookie from the cookie jar.
Who me?
Yes you.
Couldn’t be.
Then who?
Ryan stole the cookie from the cookie jar.
I used to like that song, but Mr. Loring
made us sing it so many times that I never wanted to eat another cookie for
the rest of my life.
Mr. Loring’s other favorite song was
“Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the
Bed.” That song got really old too. If any
monkeys ever jumped on my bed, I
would sell the bed. That’s disgusting! I
don’t even like it when my sister jumps
on my bed. Forget about monkeys.
“Everybody line up!” said my teacher,
Miss Daisy, after we
finished pledging the allegiance.
“Line up for
what?” we all
asked.
“It’s time to go
to music,” Miss Daisy
said.
“Yippee!” said
Andrea Young, this
really annoying girl with
curly brown hair.
“Boo!” said just about everybody else.
Nobody except Andrea and her friend
Emily wanted to go see boring, snoring
Mr. Loring.
Andrea loves everything about school.
She even loves homework. One day
Andrea asked Miss Daisy if we could
have more homework! Can you imagine
asking your teacher to give you more
homework?
Andrea is weird.

Chapter Two
Goody Two-Shoes Andrea
Miss Daisy let Andrea (the little brownnoser) be the line leader when we walked
down the hall to the music room. Her
little crybaby friend Emily was the door
holder. I walked with my pals Ryan and
Michael.
We had just turned the corner outside
our classroom when I saw the most horrible thing in the history of the world. It
was a sign on the wall by the office:
NEXT WEEK IS TV TURNOFF WEEK!
DON’T FORGET TO TURN OFF YOUR TV!
“Oh no!” Ryan groaned. “Say it’s not true!”
“I’ll die without TV!” said Michael. “TV
Turnoff Week is the worst week of the
year!”
“It’s the worst week in the history of
the world,” I said.
“What are we going to do all week
without TV?” asked Ryan.
“I might go crazy,” said Michael. It was even worse than we thought.
The sign said that TV Turnoff Week had
been such a success last year that they
decided to make it TV Turnoff Month this
year! Four whole weeks with no TV!
“Guys, this is the end of the world as
we know it,” I said.
“Oh, you boys are silly,” Andrea said.
“TV is for silly dumbheads anyway. I
never watch TV. I’d rather spend my time
singing or playing a musical instrument.”
Andrea takes violin lessons and piano
lessons and dancing lessons and singing
lessons and just about every other kind
of dumb lessons they have. If they give
lessons in anything, Andrea takes them. If
they gave lessons in how to take lessons,
Andrea would probably take them.
“My mother told me that music cleans
the soul,” she said as we walked past the
art room.
“Maybe you should try taking a bath,”
I said.
Ryan and Michael laughed at my funny
joke.
“A.J., you wouldn’t be so mean if you
tried singing instead of sitting around
watching TV all the time,” Andrea said. “I
love to sing. I can sing all the songs from
Annie. That’s my favorite movie.”
Ugh.
Then Andrea started singing that song
about the sun coming out tomorrow. It
was horrible. The police should use
Andrea’s singing to punish criminals in
jail.
“Can you sing solo?” I asked Andrea
when she finally stopped.
“Sure I can,” she said.
“Then why don’t you sing so low we
can’t hear you?”
Ryan and Michael cracked up at my
funny joke. They are true friends.
“You’re mean!” Andrea said.
“Please hold your tongue, A.J.,” said
Miss Daisy. Then she told me to be quiet
because she knew that I was going to
stick my tongue out and hold it. Finally we got to the music room. Mr.
Loring wasn’t there yet, so Miss Daisy
told us to sit on the rug.
Last year my first-grade teacher told us
to sit Indian style, but she got in trouble
because some Indian people didn’t like it. So she told us to sit like pretzels instead.
Miss Daisy doesn’t tell us to sit like
Indians or like pretzels. She just says,
“Crisscross applesauce,” which doesn’t
mean anything at all.
I sat in the second row next to Ryan
and Michael. Andrea and Emily sat in the front row, of
course. Miss Daisy said we could talk quietly until Mr. Loring arrived.
“Remember when Mr. Loring had us
sing ‘Jingle Bells’?” Michael asked.
“Yeah?”
“What’s a bobtail?” Michael asked. “You
sing ‘bells on bobtail ring,’ but I never
knew what a bobtail was.” “Beats me,” said Ryan.
“I think a bobtail is a kind of car,” I
guessed.
“Nobody names a car Bobtail,” said
Michael.
“Bob backward is still Bob,” Ryan said.
“And tuna backward is a nut.”
“Tuba backward is a butt,” I said.
“I used to have a fish named Fred,” said
Ryan.
“What does that have to do with bobtails?” asked Michael.
Nothing,” Ryan said. “I was just thinking about Fred.”
Suddenly that goody two-shoes Andrea
turned around.
“You boys are dumbheads,” she said. “A
bobtail is a little furry animal with a short
tail. Everybody knows that.”
She was probably right, but I don’t like
Andrea Young telling me anything. She
started singing “Jingle Bells.”
“Who asked you?” I interrupted. “You
don’t know anything about music.”
“Do too!” Andrea said, all mad. “I’ve
been playing the piano ever since I was
four years old.”
“Don’t you get tired?” I asked.
I thought that was a pretty funny joke,
but nobody laughed. Can’t win ’em all.
“I can even play a Beethoven sonata,”
Andrea bragged, all proud of herself.
“You play with Beethoven’s snot?” I
said. “That’s disgusting!”
Andrea got all huffy and turned back
around. Why doesn’t a piano fall on her
head?
“Boy, Mr. Loring is really late,” Michael
said.
“Maybe he died of old age,” said Ryan.
“I think we’re going to die of old age
waiting for him,” I said.
“Maybe he bored himself to death,”
said Michael.
“You boys are mean!” said that crybaby
Emily. “Mr. Loring is nice!”
She looked like she was going to cry.
What a baby! My mom says that all you
have to do to get some people upset is to
look at them sideways. I tried looking at
Emily sideways, but she didn’t even
notice.
Miss Daisy told us she was going to the
office to see what happened to Mr.
Loring. She told us to be on our best
behavior while she was gone. So as soon
as she left the room, me and Michael and
Ryan got up and shook our butts at the
class. Most of the kids laughed.
That’s when the most amazing thing in
the history of the world happened.

Chapter Three
The One-Man Funky Groove Machine
First this weird purple smoke started
pouring out on the floor in the front of
the music room. Then the sound of
drums started pounding out of a boom
box on Mr. Loring’s desk. Then the lights
went out and these laser beams started
shooting around the music room in all
different colors. It was cool!
Suddenly two men ran into the room
and started dancing around. They were
wearing football jerseys and baseball caps
and holding microphones.
“Ooh, hats aren’t allowed in school,” I
heard Andrea say to Emily. “Those men
are going to get in trouble.”
One of the guys started clapping his
hands over his head to the drumbeat.
The other one yelled into his microphone.
“Are you ready for some music class?”
the guy screamed.
We all looked at one another. We’re not
supposed to yell in school. But Miss Daisywasn’t there, so I figured it was okay.
“Yeah!” I yelled.
“I SAID, ‘ARE YOU READY FOR SOME
MUSIC CLASS?’” the guy repeated.
“Yeah!” everybody yelled.
“Are you ready to get down?” the guy
screamed.
“We’re already down!” somebody
yelled.
“And now, second graders . . . appearing
live and in person at Ella Mentry School
. . . is the one . . . the only . . . Jam Master
Hynde, the One-Man Funky Groove
Machine! Give it up, y’all! ’Cause Mr.
Hynde is in the house!”
The two guys ran out the door. The
drums got louder. The lights got brighter.
Andrea and Emily put their hands over
their ears.
That’s when Mr. Hynde ran in the door.
He was a lot younger than Mr. Loring. He
had on a baseball cap too, and he was
wearing this big purple cape with sequins
all over it. He had on sunglasses, too,
even though he was inside. I guess that
was to protect his eyes from the laser
beams.
“Ooh, he’s really cute!” all the girls said.
“Put your hands together!” Mr. Hynde
screamed. “I said, ‘PUT YOUR HANDS
TOGETHER!’”
We all started clapping. Mr. Hynde
danced around awhile, and then he
threw off his purple cape and started rapping to the beat:
“Old Mr. Loring he was over the hill.
So the board of education told him he
would have to chill.
My name is Hynde, and I’m gonna blow
your mind.
I ain’t no music teacher, I’m a born music
creature.
’Cause my daddy’s name was Amos, but
he never became famous.
So he took me on his lap, and he taught
me how to rap.
I can rhyme any line. I got juice like
Dr. Seuss. Until I hit it big , I got this teaching gig.
So sit back on your pants and dig my new
break dance.”
Mr. Hynde got down on the floor and
started spinning around on his back like
a top. Then he started spinning on his
head!
It was cool.
Finally the music and lasers stopped,
and the regular lights came back on. Mr.
Hynde took off his sunglasses and put on
regular glasses. He was panting like a dog
after a hard game of fetch.
Me and Ryan and Michael got up and
gave him a standing ovation, and the rest
of the class joined in too.
Well, everybody except for Andrea and
Emily. They just sat there, with their
mouths open and their eyes all big like
they just saw an alien spaceship or something.
“Yo, what up, homeys?” asked Mr.
Hynde.
“Are you our new music teacher?”
asked Michael.
“True that!” said Mr. Hynde. “What do
you think I am, brother, your dentist?
Welcome to music, second grade! I’m
here to rock your world.”
“I liked Mr. Loring,” Andrea whined.
Nah-nah-nah boo-boo on her! Finally
there was something at school that
Andrea didn’t like.
Anything Andrea doesn’t like, I like.
And anything Andrea likes, I don’t like.
We never agree on anything. I didn’t
even like rap music very much, but I
think I’m gonna like it now that I know
Andrea hates it.
Andrea and Emily started in brownnosing Mr. Hynde right away. They were
trying to act all cute.
“What musical instruments do you
play, Mr. Hynde?” asked Andrea.
“Sister, I play turntable,” Mr. Hynde
said.
Then he took one of those big old
black records that my parents used to
listen to in ancient times. He put it on a
record player. Then he started sliding therecord back and forth while he rubbed
the needle against it. These weird sounds
came out of the boom box. It was cool.
“Scratching records will ruin them,”
Andrea said. “You should hold records by
the edges so they don’t get scratched.”
“Can you possibly be any more
boring?” I asked her.
“Mr. Hynde,” asked Emily, “do you
know how to sing the doe a deer song?
That’s my favorite song.”
“No problemo, sister,” said Mr. Hynde.
And then he started rapping again:
“Doe a deer and deer a doe.
The deer is here and the deer is near.
But the doe she gotta go.
’Cause the doe is in a show.
And that doe she is a pro.
That’s why she gotta blow.
I hate to tell ya, Joe.
But that doe got run over by a buffalo
So that doe ain’t never gonna be no deer.
And that’s the story of doe a deer.”
Me and Ryan and Michael gave Mr.
Hynde another standing ovation.
“That’s not doe a deer!” Emily complained. “That’s a sad song about a deer
that died!”
She looked like she was going to cry,
like always.
“Chill, sister,” said Mr. Hynde. “It’s just
a song.” “Yeah, chill,” I told Emily.
Andrea said she knew the real doe a
deer song, and she started singing it. But
she only got up to the part about the
drop of golden sun when Mr. Hynde held
up his hand like a police officer telling
you to stop your car.
“Whoa, that stuff is old school, sister,”
he told Andrea. “It’s so yesterday.”
“I like Mr. Hynde’s doe a deer song
better,” I said.
“Me too!” agreed most of the other kids.
“Aren’t we going to learn about all the
great composers,” Andrea whined, “like
Beethoven and Mozart and Gershwin and
Irving Berlin?”
“Those dudes didn’t boogie,” said Mr.
Hynde. “I never listen to that stuff. This
year in music class I’m gonna teach you
how to get down and get your swerve on!
We’re gonna bust a move!”
“I don’t think I’m going to like music
class this year,” Andrea whispered to
Emily with a big worried face.
I think I’m gonna love music class this
year!

Chapter Four
The Plot to Get Rid of Mr. Hynde
“Mr. Hynde is the coolest teacher in the
history of the world,” I told the guys.
We were sitting around the vomitorium eating lunch. I traded my peach to
Ryan for his cookies because food that
has hair on it is disgusting. Ryan will eat
anything, though. Once he even ate a
bug.
“He doesn’t act like a music teacher at
all,” said Michael.
“The best part is, we’ll never have to
sing that dumb cookie jar song again!”
Ryan said. We all did a big high five over
that.
At the next table, I could hear Andrea
and Emily moaning and complaining
about Mr. Hynde.
“He’s really cute, and he’s a pretty good
singer,” Emily said. “But he doesn’t even
play any musical instruments. How can
you be a music teacher when you don’t
play a musical instrument?”
“He has no right to be teaching music,”
Andrea said. “I’m going to ask my mom totalk to Principal Klutz. Maybe she can get
Mr. Hynde fired.”
Me and Michael and Ryan turned
around at that.
“What?!” we shouted.
“Mr. Hynde is a terrible music teacher,”
Andrea said. “My mom is the PTA vice
president, and she said that if enough
parents complain about a teacher, they
can get the teacher fired.”
It figured that the school finally
replaced that old dinosaur Mr. Loring
with somebody cool and Andrea would
start complaining. What is her problem?
“I think Mr. Hynde is incompetent,”
Andrea said.
“He wears diapers?” I asked.
“Not incontinent, dumbhead!” Andrea
said. “Incompetent! It means he doesn’t
do a good job.” “Yeah,” said Emily.
That Emily agrees with everything
Andrea says. She’s so annoying. I decided
to yank her crank.
“Maybe Mr. Hynde isn’t a music
teacher at all,” I told her. “Did you ever
think of that?”
“What do you mean?” Emily asked.
“I mean maybe Mr. Loring wasn’t fired.
Maybe Mr. Hynde kidnapped him and
stuffed him in a piano and dumped it in
the river. Stuff like that happens all the
time, you know.”
Emily looked worried, like I wasn’t
even kidding. That girl will fall for anything.
“We’ve got to do something!” Emily
said. Then she went running out of the
vomitorium.
Emily is weird.

Chapter Five
Mr. Hynde Gets Funky
If Andrea and her mother got Mr. Hynde
fired, it would be a horrible disaster. I was
determined to stop them. But in the
meantime, I had another problem to
worry about.
Multiplication.
We were just starting to learn about multiplication, and I didn’t get it. I understood how 2 plus 2 equals 4. But then
how was it possible for 2 times 2 to equal
4 too? I mean, 3 plus 3 and 3 times 3 don’t
equal the same number. It just didn’t
make sense.
The way I looked at it, if 2 plus 2 equals
4, and 2 times 2 also equals 4, then addition and multiplication were the same
thing. And if they were the same thing,
why did we have
to learn both
of them? I
was having a
tough enough
time with addition
and subtraction before this multiplication stuff messed everything up.
I asked Miss Daisy to explain how 2
plus 2 and 2 times 2 can both equal 4.
“How should I know?” she replied. “I
don’t know anything about math.”
Miss Daisy is crazy!
“Everybody line up,” Miss Daisy said
after we finished putting away our math
books.
“Line up for what?”
“It’s time for music with Mr. Hynde,”
Miss Daisy said.
“Yippee!” shouted me and Michael and
Ryan.
“Boo!” said Andrea and Emily.
“Andrea, I thought you loved music,”
Miss Daisy said. “You’ve been playing
piano ever since you were four.”
“She must be really tired,” I said.
Nobody laughed at my joke again, but I
didn’t care. I’m going to keep telling that
joke until somebody laughs.
“Mr. Hynde doesn’t play music,”
Andrea said. “He just makes noise.”
“Well, we have to go to music anyway,”
said Miss Daisy.
Nah-nah-nah boo-boo on Andrea! I
hate her.
We went to the music room in single
file. This girl Annette was the line leader.
Andrea and Emily were at the end of theline, which was a first in the history of
the world. They always want to get everywhere before anyone else.
The music room was empty. But suddenly Mr. Hynde swept in and threw off
his cape.
“Should we sit like pretzels, Mr.
Hynde?” somebody asked.
“No way, homeys,” Mr. Hynde said.
“You sit for reading and writing and arithmetic. In music you get up and shake
your booty! The only way to get down is
to get up!”
Mr. Hynde jumped around like a
lunatic, and so did we. It was cool.
“Okay, my little peeps,” Mr. Hynde said.
“Today we’re gonna learn about percussion. Which one of you shorties can tell
me what percussion is?”
I raised my hand and Mr. Hynde called
on me.
“Percussion is when you say bad
words,” I said.
“That’s cussin’, brother,” Mr. Hynde
said. “Andrea?”
“Percussion is when one object hits
against another object,” she said, all
proud of herself.
“Word up, Andrea!” Mr. Hynde said.
Andrea thinks she knows everything.
I’d like to percussion her with a stick.
“Listen up,” Mr. Hynde said. He picked
up two rulers from his desk and started
hitting things with them. He hit his desk.
He hit the chalkboard. He hit the window. He hit his coffee mug.
“You hear how each object makes a different sound?” Mr. Hynde asked.
“That’s not music,” Andrea said. “It’s
just noise!”
“Oh, that’s cold, girl!” Mr. Hynde said.
“Sister, anything can be musical.”
Mr. Hynde started running around the
room, drumming on everything in sight
with the rulers. He’s a good drummer!
Then he put his foot inside a garbage can
and started tap-dancing around the room
while he kept whacking things with therulers. He’s a good tap dancer, too.
It was getting noisy! Andrea and Emily
put their hands over their ears. Mr.
Hynde started making weird drumming
sounds with his mouth while he waswhacking things with the rulers and tapdancing with the garbage can on his foot.
It was cool. Everybody except for
Andrea and Emily was dancing around.
Mr. Hynde started hitting his butt on an
empty desk while he was making weird
drumming sounds with his mouth and
whacking things with the rulers and tapdancing with the garbage can.
Mr. Hynde is out of his mind!
He was doing all those things at the
same time when suddenly, the most
amazing thing in the history of the world
happened.
The door to the music room opened.
And who do you think walked in?
It was Mr. Klutz, the school principal!
“Oh, snap!” said Mr. Hynde.
Mr. Klutz is completely bald. I mean, he
has no hair at all on his head.
Everything stopped. Mr. Hynde stood
there like a statue. A statue with a
garbage can on its foot. Everybody
stopped dancing. There was no noise at
all. We were all looking at Mr. Klutz as he
stood in the doorway.
You should have been there. It was
unbearable! We didn’t know what to say.
We didn’t know what to do. I had to think
fast.
Finally I said, “Mr. Hynde is teaching us
cussin’.” “Is that so?” Principal Klutz asked.
“Percussion,” said Mr. Hynde.
“Mr. Hynde is hitting things and
making way too much noise,” said
Andrea. “He calls that music.”
Principal Klutz walked over to Mr.
Hynde.
“Is that true, Mr. Hynde?” asked
Principal Klutz.
Nobody said a word. Nobody made a
sound. I thought I was gonna die.
“True that, sir, I’m afraid it is,” said Mr.
Hynde. He took his foot out of the
garbage can.
“He’s damaging school property and
causing a disturbance,” said Andrea. “Are
you going to fire him?” She had this evil
smile on her face.
All the kids looked at Mr. Klutz. Mr.
Klutz looked at Mr. Hynde. Mr. Hynde
looked at Mr. Klutz. And then Mr. Klutz
did the most amazing thing in the history
of the world. He started rapping:
“Mr. Hynde is phat. I’m down with that.
Even kids who are Russian gotta learn
about percussion.
So make some noise, you little girls and
boys.
I rule the school. And I say Mr. Hynde is
cool.
In school I’m king, and I say do your own
thing. Now watch me groove ’cause I can bust a
move.”
Then Mr. Klutz did a little dance and
spun on the floor on his back.
Mr. Klutz is nuts!
With Principal Klutz still sitting on the
floor, Mr. Hynde came up behind him
and started drumming the top of his bald
head like it was a bongo.
It was amazing! You should have been
there. It was almost even better than
watching TV.
Everybody except Andrea and Emily
started clapping. Mr. Klutz got up and
said he had to go back to his office and
do some important principal stuff.
“Please continue to, uh, get down and
funky with your bad self,” said Mr. Klutz.
“Peace out.”
And then he left. You should have seen the look on
Andrea’s face when Mr. Hynde was playing bongos on our principal’s head! I
guess she’s not going to get Mr. Hynde
fired after all.
Ha-ha-ha. It was the greatest thing that
ever happened in the history of the
world.
I hate her.

Chapter Six
Beauty and the Beast
I really missed TV.
TV Turnoff Month started, and I had to
go a whole day without any TV. It was
horrible! I thought I was gonna die!
Believe it or not, I couldn’t wait for
school to start. There’s a TV in our classroom, but we hardly ever get to watch it, so at least I wasn’t missing anything.
Plus, we had music class. And music
class with Mr. Hynde is better than TV
anyway.
“Good news, my little shorties,” Mr.
Hynde said. “In honor of TV Turnoff
Month, we’re gonna put on a play!”
“Yippee!” shouted all the girls. “Plays
are fun.”
“Boo!” moaned all the boys. “Plays are
dumb.”
“This play’s gonna be off the hook,
dudes,” Mr. Hynde told us. “It’s gonna be
a hip-hop play.”
“I was in a play at day camp last
summer,” said Andrea. “It was called The
Princess and the Pea. I played the beautiful princess.”
“Did you pee right on the stage?” I
asked. “That’s disgusting!”
“Not that kind of pea, A.J.!”
“We’re gonna put on Beauty and the
Beast,” said Mr. Hynde. “Now who wants
to be Beauty?”
“I do! I do! I do!” shouted Andrea and a
few of the other girls.
Mr. Hynde did eeny meeny minie moe,
and guess which smarty-pants brownnoser little Miss Perfect who should have
a refrigerator fall on her head won?
“Okay, Andrea is the beauty,” said Mr.
Hynde. “Now which one of you littledudes wants to be the beast?”
None of us boys raised his hand. No
way I was going to be some dumb beast
in a dumb play.
“Don’t bail on me, brothers,” Mr. Hynde
said. “One of you homeboys has to be the
beast or we can’t have the play.”
I looked over at Ryan and Michael.
They were both looking at the floor and
had their arms folded across their chests.
“We don’t want to be in a play,” Ryan
said.
“Oh, I forgot to clue you,” Mr. Hynde
said. “The beast gets to lock Beauty in a
dungeon and torture her.”
“I’ll be the beast!” I shouted before
anybody else could get his hand in the
air.
“Okay, A.J. is the beast,” Mr. Hynde
said.
This play is going to be cool!

Chapter Seven
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
Me and Ryan and Michael were sitting
around the playground at recess. Michael
was looking through the script for the
play that Mr. Hynde gave me.
“Did you read this, A.J.?” Michael asked.
“Nah,” I said, “reading is boring.”
“Well, you might want to read this,”
Michael said. “It
says here that the
beast has to kiss
Beauty.”
“What?! Let me see
that!” I grabbed the
script. He was
right! It said
it right there
on the last
page.
Beauty and
the beast kiss.
“Oooooh!” Ryan
said. “A.J. and Andrea
are in love!”
“Shut up!” I said. “I thought I just had
to lock her in a dungeon.”
“First you lock her in a dungeon,”
Michael said. “In the end you fall in love
and you’ve got to kiss her.”
“That’s disgusting!” I said. “I wouldn’t
kiss Andrea if they paid me a million
dollars.”
“You’re gonna have to,” Michael said.
“And nobody’s gonna pay you a dime.”
Then Michael and Ryan started singing:
“A.J. and Andrea sitting in a tree
k-i-s-s-i-n-g!
First comes love, then comes marriage.
Then comes A.J. with a baby carriage!”
If those guys weren’t my best friends,
I would really hate them.
“I won’t do it!” I said. “I’ll run away
someplace where they’ll never find me.”
Michael and Ryan sang the dumb kissing song again, so I left. I was really mad.
I didn’t exactly know where to run to. I
figured I’d go to the boys’ room and hang
out in there for a while.
But on the way to the boys’ room, I
passed the music room. The door was
closed, but there’s a little window in the
door. I stood on my tiptoes and looked
inside. Mr. Hynde was in there.
I put my ear against the door. I could
hear a drum machine, and Mr. Hynde
was rapping, too. I couldn’t make out the
words. I opened the door.
“Yo, Beast!” Mr. Hynde said. “You the
man! How’s it hangin’, brother?”
“Okay, I guess,” I said. “What are you
doing?”
“Layin’ down some beats,” Mr. Hynde
said. “I’m workin’ on my own CD.”
“Cool!” I said. “Are you gonna be a
famous rapper?”
“Word up, cuz,” Mr. Hynde said.
“Maybe someday I’ll be a star and you
can say I used to be your music teacher.
Hey, you want my autograph? Once I get
famous, I might not sign ’em anymore.”
“No thanks,” I said.
“What’s the matter, Beast?” said Mr.
Hynde. “You bummed out ’cause you
can’t watch TV?”
“No, I’ve got a problem, Mr. Hynde.”
“Be straight,” he said. “You can tell me.”
“I don’t want to be the beast.”
“Why not, dude?” Mr. Hynde asked.
“The beast is the man! The beast rules!”
“I don’t want to kiss Andrea Young,” I
admitted.
“Ohhhh,” Mr. Hynde said. “Kissin’ is
gross, eh? ’Fraid you’ll get cooties?”
“Well, yeah.”
“Let me clue you, brother,” said Mr.
Hynde. “Kissin’ girls is fly. Someday all
you’re gonna wanna do is kiss girls. Someday, when you wanna kiss a girl,
that girl might not wanna kiss you. It’s
kinda like gettin’ my autograph. You
should do it now, ’cause you might not
have the chance later. Besides, it’s just a
play. It doesn’t mean you like her.”
“But Andrea is horrible and disgusting!”
Mr. Hynde sat down at his desk.
“A.J., when I was a little shortie like
you, I thought green beans were horrible
and disgusting,” he said. “But my mama
said I had to eat ’em. She told me to pretend the green beans were somethin’ I
really liked. So I pretended they were oatmeal cookies. Then they didn’t taste so
bad. See what I mean?”
“I don’t like oatmeal cookies,” I said.
“Well, what do you like?” Mr. Hynde
asked. I thought about it for a minute.
“I like dirt bikes,” I said. “When I grow
up, I’m gonna be a dirt bike racer.”
“So pretend Andrea is a dirt bike,” he
suggested.
“Huh?”
“Go ahead, give it a shot,” Mr. Hynde
said. “We need you in there. You’re my
beast, dude. Nobody else can be the
beast. You’re the beast from the east.”
“Well, okay,” I said.
I still didn’t know if I’d be able to kiss
Andrea without throwing up.

Chapter Eight
The Play
For the next week, the second grade
rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed
the play. After school I went home and
rehearsed my lines some more. I couldn’t
turn on the TV anyway, so it was good to
have something to do.
In school we rehearsed the whole playfrom start to finish. It was fun torturing
Andrea. The only part we didn’t rehearse
was the kissing part. Mr. Hynde said we
would save that for the real show on
Friday night.
Ryan and Michael couldn’t believe that
I was really going to kiss Andrea. I told
them that Mr. Hynde said it wouldn’t be
so horrible if I pretended she was a dirt
bike.
“I wouldn’t kiss a dirt bike,” Ryan said.
“Well, what would you kiss?” I asked.
“I really like football,” Ryan said. “I’d
kiss a football.”
Ryan is weird.
Finally the night of the big show
arrived. Everybody was dressed up in his
or her costume. We peeked through the
curtains in the multipurpose room and
saw all the parents were there. I was nervous. Mr. Hynde told us everything was
going to be fine.
We were waiting for the curtain to
open when Andrea pulled me aside.
“A.J.,” she said, “I want you to know
that just because we have to kiss each
other doesn’t mean I like you.”
“I don’t like you, either,” I said.
“Good,” she said. “I’m glad we agree on
something.”
“Kissing girls is gross,” I told her.
“Kissing boys is gross too,” she said. “Ieven went to Mr. Hynde and told him I
didn’t want to be in the play because I
didn’t want to kiss you.”
“So did I!”
“He told me I should pretend that
you’re something I really like,” Andrea
said.
“That’s what he told me!” I said. “I’m
going to pretend you’re a dirt bike.”
“I’m going to pretend you’re an encyclopedia,” Andrea said.
“Fine.”
So we did the play. I remembered all
my lines, and locking Andrea in the dungeon was fun. Everything was going
great.
But the whole time, in the back of my
mind, I was thinking that soon I would
have to kiss Andrea. It was a horrible
thought.
We were a minute away from the big
kissing part. The whole cast was up on
the stage.
Andrea was standing right next to me.
I was really nervous.
Michael leaned over and whispered in
my ear. “Remember, she’s a dirt bike,” he
said.
Emily leaned over and whispered to
Andrea. “Remember, he’s an encyclopedia,” she said.
And then, before I could catch mybreath, it was time. The big moment.
The kiss.
I leaned over toward Andrea.
Andrea leaned over toward me.
My heart was beating fast. I closed my
eyes.
Dirt bike. Dirt
bike. Dirt bike. Dirt
bike.
I was trying really
hard to pretend that
Andrea was a dirt
bike.
And at that very
moment, the most
amazing thing in thehistory of the world happened.
Andrea didn’t kiss me.
I opened my eyes. Andrea had stepped
up to the microphone at the front of the
stage.
She started singing! “ ‘The sun will come out tomorrow . . .’”
she sang.
She was singing that dumb stick-outyour-chin-and-grin song from that Annie
movie! It wasn’t even in the script!
“‘Tomorrow! Tomorrow! I love you
tomorrow . . .’”
It was horrible and all, but it was still
the greatest moment in my life because
at least I didn’t have to kiss Andrea.
All the parents were smiling and nodding their heads. When Andrea finished
singing the dumb song, they all went
crazy, clapping and cheering and
whistling and stamping their feet. Andrea
bowed, and the play was over.
“I’m sorry, A.J.,” Andrea said to me
during the standing ovation. “I just
couldn’t do it. I was afraid that if I kissed
you, I might throw up.”
“Thanks,” I said. “Me too.”
Andrea gave me a hug. “Oooooh!” Ryan said, “A.J. and Andrea
are in love!”
The audience was still clapping when
we noticed Mr. Hynde at the side of the
stage behind the curtain. He was crying!
We all ran over to him. Tears were
streaming down his cheeks. I figured Mr.
Hynde was upset because Andrea messed
up his hip-hop
play.
“What’s wrong,
Mr. Hynde?”
Emily asked.
“What was that
song?” he asked,
wiping the tears
with his sleeve.
“It’s called ‘Tomorrow,’” Andrea said.
“It’s from Annie.”
“It’s the most beautiful song I ever
heard,” Mr. Hynde said. And then he
started crying again.
Mr. Hynde is weird.

Chapter Nine
TV, at Last
We were supposed to have music on
Monday, but Mr. Hynde was absent. We
were kind of worried. Maybe he was sick,
or maybe a meteor hit his house or something. That stuff happens all the time. But
Miss Daisy told us he was fine and that
we shouldn’t worry so much.
A few days later, after we finished
pledging the allegiance, Principal Klutz
made an announcement over the loudspeaker.
“Teachers, please turn on the TV sets in
your rooms,” he said.
We all gasped.
“But it’s still TV Turnoff Month!” just
about everybody in the whole school
yelled.
“Forget about that!” Mr. Klutz said.
“Turn on your TVs! There is a very special
tape I need everyone to see.”
Whatever Mr. Klutz wanted us to see
must have been really important. Even
before TV Turnoff Month, we were hardlyever allowed to watch TV during school.
Miss Daisy went to the front of the class
and turned on the TV.
It had been so long since I’d seen TV
that I almost forgot what it looked like.
But it didn’t take me long to figure out
what was on the screen.
It was this dumb show called American
Idol, where people get up and sing dumb
songs and these dumb judges tell them
how bad they sing. People vote for them,
and one by one the singers have to leave
until there is a winner. Why the heck did
Principal Klutz want us to watch that?
Some announcer guy said, “Our next
contestant is a music teacher at the Ella
Mentry School—”
And out walked Mr. Hynde!
I just about fell out of my seat.
Everybody in the class gasped.
We couldn’t believe it! It was the most
amazing thing that ever happened in the
history of the world! You should havebeen there. Our own Mr. Hynde was on
TV!
“He’s been working on his own rap
CD,” I told everybody.
“This is gonna be cool,” said Ryan.
Mr. Hynde stepped up to the microphone. He looked a little nervous. Music
started playing and Mr. Hynde started
singing.
“‘The sun will come out tomorrow. . . .’”
I wouldn’t believe it! Mr. Hynde wasn’t
singing one of his rap songs. He was
singing that dumb bet-your-bottomdollar song! Tears were rolling down his
cheeks while he sang.
“‘Tomorrow . . . tomorrow . . .’”
After he finished the song, we all
cheered. Even me, and I hate that dumb
song. I thought the judges were going to
say how terrible Mr. Hynde was, because
they pretty much hate everybody. But
they didn’t. They said he was really good.
And when it was announced that Mr.
Hynde was going to advance to the next
round, we all went crazy.

Chapter Ten
And the Winner Is . . .
Finally TV Turnoff Month ended and life
went back to normal. I watched Mr.
Hynde every night on that American Idol
show. One night he sang a rap song. The
next night he came out with a guitar and
a crazy costume and sang a rock ’n’ roll
song. He could really play guitar! The
night after that he sang
a country song about
his dog dying.
We all kept thinking
Mr. Hynde was going
to get voted off the
show, but he didn’t.
The other singers were horrible, and the
judges said really mean things to them.
One by one, they were sent home.
Mr. Hynde’s picture was in the newspaper. Everybody at school was talking
about him.
We missed music class two weeks in a
row because Mr. Hynde was working on
the TV show. But we didn’t mind. We were so proud of him.
Finally there were just two singers left.
Mr. Hynde was one of them. The other
one was this lady with a big nose. One of
them was going to be the winner.
It all came down to Saturday night. Mr.
Hynde sang a song, and then the lady
with the big nose sang a song.
And guess what?
Well, I’m not even going to tell you
because I don’t want to. So nah-nah-nah
boo-boo on you.
Okay, okay, that was mean. I’ll tell you.
Mr. Hynde won! He really won! It was
the greatest thing that ever happened in
the history of the world!

Chapter Eleven
One Last Song
On Monday morning everybody came to
school excited. We got even more excited
when Miss Daisy told us to line up for
music class.
“Yippee!” everybody yelled, even Emily
and Andrea.
We couldn’t wait to get to the music
room to congratulate Mr. Hynde.
Everybody wanted to be the line leader.
Finally we got to the music room all
out of breath. But nobody was there.
“Where’s Mr. Hynde?” we all asked.
“I’ll bet he’s going to make a big
entrance, like he usually does,” Ryan said.
“I’m ready to get down and boogie,”
Michael said.
So we waited. And we waited and
waited and waited. Finally, after about a
million hundred years, the door opened.
And you won’t believe who walked in.
It was Mr. Loring!
Boring, snoring Mr. Loring was standing there, looking as boring as ever.
Everybody gasped.
“Sit down, please,” Mr. Loring said. “We
always sit down for music class.”
“Mr. Loring!” Andrea asked. “What are
you doing here?”
“I am here to teach music, of course,”
he said.
“What happened to Mr. Hynde?” I
asked.
“Apparently he quit,” said Mr. Loring.
“What?” I shouted. “That’s not fair!”
“Principal Klutz asked me to come
back,” Mr. Loring said, “and I agreed,
against my better judgment.”
Everybody moaned. Mr. Loring reached
into his jacket and pulled out a piece of
paper. “Mr. Hynde left a note for you,” he said.
“Would you like me to read it?”
“Yeah!”
So Mr. Loring read Mr. Hynde’s note:
“I hope you dudes don’t think I’m rude.
Don’t moan and cry ’cause I didn’t say
good-bye.
I had to keep it real ’til I got a record
deal.
But now I hit it big, so I quit my teaching
gig.
You kids are cool. I dig your school.
Wherever I go, whatever I do,
There’s one thing true.
I’ll always remember you.”
Emily started crying, that crybaby.
Well, to be honest, we all started
crying.
“I realize you’re sad that Mr. Hynde is
no longer here,” said Mr. Loring. “Maybe
if we sing a song, it will make you feel
better.” “Can we sing that sun will come out
tomorrow song?” I asked. “That will cheer
us up.”
“Yeah, it will remind us of Mr. Hynde,”
said Michael.
“I was thinking of something else,” Mr.
Loring said. And then he began to sing:
“Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?
A.J. stole the cookie from the cookie jar.
Who me?
Yes you.
Couldn’t be.
Then who?
Emily stole the cookie from the cookie jar.”
No! Not that song! Anything but that
song!
Mr. Loring made us sing that dumb
cookie jar song over and over again until
everybody’s name in the whole class
was mentioned. It was horrible. I thought I was gonna die.
Well, it looks like boring, snoring Mr.
Loring is back at Ella Mentry School for
the rest of the year. I guess we’re just
gonna have to put up with him until Mr.
Klutz hires a new music teacher.
Like the song says, we’ll have to stick
out our chins and grin. We’re gonna have
to hang on till tomorrow, come what may.
But it won’t be easy!
