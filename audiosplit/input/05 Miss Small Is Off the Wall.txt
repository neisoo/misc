Chapter One
Fizz Ed Is the Coolest
My name is A.J. and I hate school.
Well, I hate that reading and writing
and arithmetic part of school, anyway.
That stuff is for the birds!
There’s only one thing about school
that I like.
Fizz Ed.
Fizz Ed! I love Fizz Ed! Fizz Ed is the
coolest! Fizz Ed isn’t even like school at
all. Fizz Ed is what you would be doing if
you didn’t have to go to school. If you
ask me, school would be cool if we could
just have Fizz Ed all day long and forget
about all that boring reading and writing
and arithmetic stuff.
Well, actually, to be honest, I’ve never
had Fizz Ed. At my school, the Ella
Mentry School, we didn’t have Fizz Ed
last year when we were in first grade. But
my friend Billy around the corner goes to
a different school. Billy’s in third grade,
and he told me that at his school they
play dodgeball and basketball and
football in Fizz Ed. They get to do anything they want.
Man, I wish I could go to Billy’s school
instead of boring old Ella Mentry School.
I’ve been waiting forever until I got to
second grade, when we would have Fizz
Ed.
“Okay, everybody, it’s time to line up,”
my teacher, Miss Daisy, announced one
morning after we pledged the allegiance.
“Line up for what?” we all asked.
“Fizz Ed!” Miss Daisy said. “We’re going
to meet Miss Small in the gym.”
“Yippee!”

Chapter Two
Smarty-pants and Dumbhead
“Yippee!” I shouted.
“Hooray!” shouted my friends Ryan and
Michael. We all whooped and hollered
and high-fived each other. Finally we
could go to Fizz Ed and leave all that reading and writing and arithmetic behind for
a change. Miss Daisy gave each of us a
name tag so Miss Small, the Fizz Ed
teacher, would know who we were.
“What’s Fizz Ed?” asked this girl who
has red hair named Emily (well, actually
the girl is named Emily, not her hair).
“Are we going to learn about soda pop?”
Me and Ryan and Michael slapped our
own heads. We couldn’t believe it. That
was like the stupidest thing anybody ever
said in the history of the world.
“Fizz Ed is gym class, dumbhead!” I
told Emily. “Everybody knows that.”
Emily looked all upset like she was
going to start crying. That girl cries at
any old thing.
“A.J.!” Miss Daisy said with her
mean face. “Hold your
tongue!”
“Okay.”
So I stuck out my
tongue and held onto
it. Everybody laughed.
Well, everybody but
Emily and Miss Daisy.
The whole class lined up in size order
so Miss Daisy could walk us over to the
gym, which is all the way at the other end
of the school. Ryan was the line leader.
“I bet Miss Small will let us play football and baseball and hockey and dodgeball,” Michael whispered to me as we
walked. Michael and Ryan are really
good at sports. They’re the best athletes
in the second grade.
“Sports are cool,” I said.
“Except for curling,” said Michael.
“That’s just dumb.”
“That’s not even a sport,” I said.
“Curling is what girls do to their hair.”
This girl with curly brown hair named
Andrea Young must have heard me,
because she laughed even though I
didn’t say anything funny.
“Curling is too a sport,” she said. “I saw
it in a book about the Olympics. They
take this big rock and slide it down the
ice while somebody sweeps the ice in
front of it with a broom.”
Andrea thinks she is so smart. She
probably goes home after school and
reads the dictionary for fun. That way
she can brag about how much she
knows.
“You don’t know anything about
sports,” I told Andrea.
“Do too,” Andrea said back at me. “I
take a dance class every day after school.
I’m learning ballet, jazz, tap, hip-hop,
and clog dancing.”
Andrea is one of those kids who takes
lessons in everything. All she has to do is
sneeze and her mother probably signs
her up for sneezing lessons.
“Dancing is not a sport,” I said.
“Dancing is dumb.”
“A little less chitchatting in the hall,
please,” said Miss Daisy as we walked to
the gym.
“Do we really have to go to Fizz Ed,
Miss Daisy?” asked Andrea. “Isn’t it more
important for us to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic?”
“Strong mind, strong body,” said Miss
Daisy.
Ha-ha-ha! Smarty-pants Andrea Young
was gonna to have to do something she
didn’t like for a change. She wouldn’t be
the best in the class for a change.
Welcome to my world, Andrea!
I couldn’t wait to beat Andrea at basketball. Beat her at baseball. Beat her at
football. This was going to be the greatest day in my life!
Andrea Young probably doesn’t even
know the difference between a football
and a footprint.
Finally, after walking about a hundred
miles, we reached the gym. It’s this giant
room with a basketball hoop at each end.
“Miss Small?” called Miss Daisy. “Are
you here?”
Nobody answered, but there was an
echo in the gym so we could hear Miss
Daisy’s words over and over again when
they bounced off the walls.
“Miss Small? . . . Miss Small? . . . Miss
Small? . . . Miss Small? . . . Are you here?
. . . Are you here? . . . Are you here?”
It was cool.
“Hello!” I yelled.
The gym yelled back, “Hello! . . . Hello!
. . . Hello! . . . Hello! . . . Hello!”
“Echo!” yelled Michael.
“Echo . . . echo . . . echo . . . echo,”
yelled the gym.
“A.J. is stupid!” yelled Ryan.
“A.J. is stupid! . . . A.J. is stupid! . . . A.J.
is stupid! . . . A.J. is stupid!” yelled the
gym.
I was gonna yell, “Ryan is a dumbhead,” but instead Miss Daisy yelled,
“Stop that, boys!”
“Stop that, boys! . . . Stop that, boys! . . .
Stop that, boys!” yelled the gym.
It was cool.
At that very moment, somebody came
running out of the office at the other end
of the gym. It was the most amazing
thing any of us had ever seen.
It was Miss Small.
Chapter Three
Fun, Fun, Fun with Miss Small
Miss Small was carrying a basketball, a
football, a soccer ball, a kickball, and just
about every other kind of ball you could
name. She ran out and climbed up on the
bleachers. Then she jumped off the
bleachers and jumped on one of those
little trampolines on the floor.
She did a
flip, went flying
through the air, and tried to
dunk all those balls in the
basketball hoop. One or two of
them went in, but mostly they
went flying all over the place.
So did Miss Small. She landed in a
heap on the floor.
Miss Small is off the wall!
“Are you okay?” we all asked as we
gathered around her. I was afraid she
might have broken something, because
she was just lying there without moving.
“I’m fit as a fiddle!” Miss Small replied.
“I just wanted to show you how you’re
not supposed to behave in the gym. In
Fizz Ed, safety is our biggest concern.”
Miss Daisy said she had to go back to
class, and she left. Miss Small stood up
slowly. It was amazing! Nobody could do
anything except stare at her with their
mouth open.
“Wow!” we all said.
The amazing thing was that Miss Small
was really tall! Like, she
was a million inches
big. Her head just
about reached the
basketball hoop. It was
like a giant had walked
into the room. She must be
the tallest person in the
history of the world!
Miss Small was
the opposite of her
name. It was like a
fat guy was named
Mr. Thin or a dumb guy
was named Mr. Smart or a
really handsome guy was
named Mr. Ugly or . . . well, you get the
idea.
Miss Small blew into the shiny silver
whistle that was hanging around her neck.
“Hey, kids! Are you ready to have some
fun?”
“Yeah!” we all hollered.
“We’re going to have lots of fun in Fizz
Ed!” she said. “Fun fun fun, all the time!
That’s my motto.”
“What’s a motto?” asked Ryan.
“I don’t know,” Miss Small said.
“What’s a motto with you?”
Then she laughed.
“Do you like to play games?” Miss
Small asked. “I love playing games!”
“I like to play video games,” one of the
boys said.
“Those aren’t the kind of games I’m
talking about,” said Miss Small. “Real
games are even more fun. I’m talking
about running and jumping and chasing
games. We’re going to play Red Light
Green Light, Red Rover, Spud, Mother
May I, Duck Duck Goose. . . .”
“Those games are lame,” Ryan whispered in my ear.
“Kids can get hurt when they run and
jump and chase each other,” said
Andrea. “My mother told me to always
be careful so I don’t get hurt.”
“Can you possibly be any more
boring?” I asked Andrea.
She is gonna make a great grown-up
when she grows up. She’s only eight, and
she’s already mature, which is a fancy
way to say boring.
“Do we have to play games where
somebody loses?” asked that crybaby
Emily. “I think the team that loses should
win too. My dad told me I’m a winner
whether I win or lose.”
“Your dad is weird,” I said, even
though Emily looked like she might cry
again. “If everybody wins, what’s the
point of playing the game? That’s why
you play. To beat the other team.”
“Competing is icky,” said Andrea.
“It doesn’t matter if you win or lose, A.J.
It’s how you play the game that counts,”
said Miss Small. “In Fizz Ed, our goal is to
have fun and build strong, healthy
bodies. But most of all, by the end of the
term, I want you all to have cooties.”
“Cooties!” everybody shrieked.
“Girls have cooties!” shouted all the
boys.
“Boys have cooties!” shouted all the girls.
I never really knew what cooties were,
but I knew they were something horrible
that you wouldn’t want to get.
“Everybody should have cooties,” said
Miss Small. “Cooties stands for COOperation, TEAmwork, and Sportsmanship.”
Oh. I didn’t care much about that
stuff. I just wanted to beat Andrea Young
at something because she thinks she is so
smart. Besides, words that are made from
the letters of other words are dumb.
Miss Small blew her whistle again.
“Before we do anything, we have to
stretch.”
Miss Small got down on the floor again
and did some push-ups. Then we had to
do push-ups. She did some sit-ups. Then
we had to do sit-ups. She did some windmills and arm circles. Then we had to do
windmills and arm circles.
“See if you can touch your toes,” Miss
Small said. “Now see if you can touch the
sky. You want to be loose as a goose in a
caboose.”
Stretching was boring, and dumb, too.
Nobody can touch the sky. After we
stretched, Miss Small made us do about a
million hundred jumping jacks.
“Isn’t this fun?” Miss Small asked when
we were finished.
I thought I was gonna throw up.
She blew her whistle again.
“Okay, now that we’re all as loose as a
goose in a caboose, who wants to play a
game?”
“I do!” we all shouted.
Finally!
Chapter Four
A Dumb Balancing Act
“Are we gonna play football?” I asked
Miss Small.
“No,” Miss Small said.
“How about basketball?” asked Ryan.
“Nope.”
“Soccer?”
“Not even close.”
“Baseball? Hockey? Tennis?”
“No. No. No.”
“Curling?” I asked.
“No.”
“I thought you said we were gonna
have fun,” Michael complained.
“I did,” said Miss Small.
“So what are we gonna do?” I asked.
Miss Small went to a box near the
bleachers and pulled out some giant
feathers that were as long as her arms.
“We’re going to balance these peacock
feathers,” she said.
“What!” I asked.
“Whoever can balance a feather on
their finger the longest is the winner,”
Miss Small said. She took a feather and
balanced it on her finger. “See, it’s easy!”
She gave each of us a feather. I put the
feather on my finger. It fell off right
away. I put it back on my finger, and it
fell off again. I tried moving my finger
back and forth like Miss Small did to hold
the feather up, but it fell off anyway.
Balancing feathers
was not fun. It was
dumb.
I looked up to see if
Ryan could balance
his feather. But
his fell off. I
turned around
to see how Michael was doing. His
feather fell off too.
In fact, there was only one kid in the
whole class who was still balancing the
dumb feather.
It was Andrea Young! Her dumb feather
was just standing up all straight on her
dumb finger like it was glued there.
“Good job, Andrea!” said Miss Small.
“You have excellent balance.” And she
gave Andrea a certificate that said she
was a feather-balancing expert.
“Thanks, Miss Small,” Andrea said.
“Maybe Fizz Ed won’t be so bad after all!”
I hate her.
Chapter Five
Howdy, Pardner!
After we were finished with that dumb
stuff, Miss Small collected all the feathers
and blew her whistle.
“Okay, let’s have all the boys line up on
one side of the gym and all the girls line
up on the other side.”
“All right!” I whispered to Ryan. “We’re
gonna play dodgeball.”
Dodgeball is this cool game where you
get to throw balls at the kids on the other
side of the gym and try to hit them. It’s
the only game I know of where the
object of the game is to hurt people.
Dodgeball rules!
“Watch this,” I told Ryan. “When I get
the ball, I’m gonna wham Andrea Young
right in the head.”
Me and Ryan high-fived. Then we
switched places so I could be right across
from Andrea. That way I could get a
good shot at her.
The only problem was that Miss Small
didn’t go get any dodgeballs. When all
the boys and girls were lined up on opposite sides of the gym, she went over to a
boom box on the floor and turned it on.
This annoying hillbilly music blasted out
of the boom box. Miss Small put a big
straw hat on her head and started dancing around like a lunatic.
“Yee-haw!” she hollered. “I reckon it’s
time for some square dancing!”
“What!” I shouted. “We’re not supposed to dance in Fizz Ed. We’re supposed to play ball and stuff. Square
dancing is dumb.”
But nobody could hear me because the
girls were all whooping and squealing
like they were opening their birthday
presents or something.
“Everybody sashay to the middle of the
gym and honor your partner!” Miss Small
shouted. She was clapping her hands to
the music.
I looked for Ryan and Michael, but
they had already sashayed to the middle
of the gym with the rest of the boys. I
didn’t want to be the only one standing
there on the line, so I sashayed to the
middle too.
“Howdy, pardner!” Andrea Young said
to me, and she did one of those courtesy
things girls do with their skirts.
No way I was gonna bow and say,
“Howdy, pardner.” I didn’t want to honor
Andrea. I wanted to nail her in the head
with a dodgeball.
“Swing your partner round and round!”
shouted Miss Small.
Andrea grabbed my elbow and swung
herself around me about a hundred
million times.
“Hey, look!” Ryan shouted. “A.J. and
Andrea are in love!”
“Shut up, Ryan!”
Then we all went back to our boy and
girl places. I thought I was gonna throw
up from all that spinning.
“Clap your hands!” ordered Miss Small.
“Circle left!” ordered Miss Small.
“Circle right!” ordered Miss Small.
“Now do-si-do!” ordered Miss Small.
“Do-si-what?” we all asked.
Miss Small showed us how to do-si-do,
which is sort of like walking around
somebody like you’re pretending you
don’t see them. It was dumb.
I couldn’t believe it. Instead of playing
dodgeball or something cool with my
friends, I had to do-si-do with Andrea
Young. It wasn’t fair.
“Isn’t Fizz Ed fun, A.J?” Andrea asked the
next time we had to meet in the middle.
Why can’t an asteroid fall on her?
After the square-dance disaster, Miss
Small had us do the Chicken Dance. Now
I don’t know if they do the Chicken
Dance where you live,
but it’s the dumbest
dance in the history of
the world.
Everybody has to
stand in a big circle
and tuck their thumbs
into their armpits.
Then you have to flap your elbows like a
chicken and cluck. Then you have to
wiggle down to the floor and sing, “I
don’t want to be a chicken. I don’t want
to be a duck. So I shake my butt.”
Really! Those are the words! If that’s
not dumb, I don’t know what is. It was
horrible.
When we finished the Chicken Dance,
Miss Small showed us how to do somersaults. Then she ran all the way around
the gym, and we had to follow her. I
thought I was gonna die. Luckily she
blew her whistle and told us that Fizz Ed
was over for the day.
I couldn’t wait to get out of there.
Chapter Six
The Truth
About Miss Small
At our school the cafeteria and the auditorium are the same room, so it’s called
the cafetorium. But all the kids call it the
vomitorium ever since some kindergarten kid barfed in there last year.
I sit at a lunch table with Ryan and
Michael and a few other boys. Andrea
and Emily and some of their friends sit at
the table next to ours. Sometimes for fun
we peel the paper off our straws and
shoot them at the girls. They usually
laugh, except for the time I hit Emily in
the face and she cried.
I gave my tuna sandwich to Ryan, and
he gave me his Scooter Pie. Ryan will
eat anything, even disgusting vegetables.
One time me and Michael mixed up some
milk and ketchup and mayonnaise in a
cup. It was really gross, and I thought I
was gonna throw up just looking at it.
Ryan said he would drink it if we gave
him a pack of baseball cards. So we gave
him a pack of baseball cards and he
drank it (the drink, not the baseball
cards). Ryan is weird.
“That Miss Small must be seven feet
tall,” Ryan said.
“If I was as tall as she is,” Michael said,
“I wouldn’t be a gym teacher. I’d be a
professional basketball player.”
“I would be a weatherman,” Ryan said.
“Why?” I asked.
“Because when you’re that tall, you
can tell it’s raining before anybody else.
So you can predict the weather.”
“Tall people can reach stuff on the top
shelf without even having to stand on a
chair, too,” Michael said. “But I guess it
must be really hard to tie your shoes
when you’re so tall.”
“She should tie her shoes first and then
put them on,” Ryan said.
At the table next to ours, Andrea Young
turned around with her big dumb face.
“You can’t tie your shoes and then put
them on,” she said.
“Can too,” I said, and I shot my straw
wrapper at Andrea. “I only tie my shoes
once— the day my mom buys them.
What’s the point of untieing a shoe if
you’re just gonna have to tie it all over
again the next day?”
“Yeah,” Ryan and Michael agreed. Girls
just don’t have common sense.
“Boys are dumbheads,” Andrea said,
giggling, and then she turned back to her
own table. I wish a basketball backboard
would crush her.
“I thought we were gonna be playing
sports in Fizz Ed,” Ryan complained.
“When I saw how tall Miss Small was, I was
sure she was gonna let us play basketball.”
“Maybe she’s not our Fizz Ed teacher at
all,” Michael said. “Did you ever think of
that? Maybe she’s a mutant alien freak
from another planet where everybody is
tall.”
“Yeah,” Ryan said. “Maybe she’s a fake.
Maybe she came to earth to kidnap our
real Fizz Ed teacher and bring her back to
her planet.”
All of a sudden Emily turned around.
Her face was all white.
“We’ve got to do something!” Emily
said, and she ran out of the vomitorium.
Emily is weird.
Chapter Seven
Fizz Ed Is Dumb
“Okay, everybody, it’s time to line up,”
Miss Daisy announced later in the week.
“Line up for what?” we all asked.
“Fizz Ed!” Miss Daisy said.
“Yippee!” shouted all the girls.
“Boo!” shouted all the boys.
“What’s the matter?” Miss Daisy asked.
“I thought you boys would love Fizz Ed.”
“Fizz Ed is dumb,” I told her. “All we do
is balance feathers and square-dance.”
Miss Daisy said we had to go to Fizz Ed
anyway, and we walked a million hundred miles to the gym. Emily was the line
leader, and I was the door holder.
“Good morning, boys and girls,” said
Miss Small. “Today we are going to do
something really exciting. We’re going to
learn how to juggle scarves!”
“What! ” I said. “You’ve gotta be kidding!”
But she wasn’t. Miss Small grabbed a
bunch of colorful scarves and gave three
of them to each of us. Then she put on a
little demonstration.
First she threw one scarf up in the air.
Then she threw another one up in the
air. Then she threw the third one up in
the air. Then she caught the first one as
it was falling and threw it back up in the
air again. And she kept doing that with
all three scarves over and over.
It looked pretty cool, I had to admit.
“How can you juggle three scarves
with just two hands?” I asked.
“It’s easy because the scarves float in
the air,” Miss Small said. “This will
improve your eye-hand coordination.
With a little practice, you’ll be able to
juggle three balls, or three clubs, or three
of just about anything.”
Miss Small blew her whistle and told us
to give it a try. I threw a scarf up in the
air, and then I threw another one. By the
time I threw the third scarf up in the air,
the first scarf had already fallen on the
floor and the second scarf had landed on
my head.
“My scarves are busted,” I complained.
“They don’t float long enough. I need
another set of scarves.”
Miss Small gave me three more
scarves, but the same thing happened.
Every time I tried to grab a scarf out of
the air, the other two were on the ground
already.
Juggling scarves was dumb, I decided.
It wasn’t a sport. They don’t have any
World Series for scarf juggling. There’s no
scarf-juggling Super Bowl. They don’t
give out any medals for scarf juggling in
the Olympics. Juggling scarves was just
about as dumb as curling.
I looked around to see how Ryan and
Michael were doing. They weren’t very
good at juggling the dumb scarves
either. In fact, there was only one kid in
the whole class who was keeping all
three scarves up in the air.
Andrea Young!
“Way to go, Andrea!” yelled Miss Small.
“You have excellent eye-hand coordination.” Then she gave Andrea some
certificate that said she was an expert
scarf juggler.
“Thanks, Miss Small,” Andrea said.
“Juggling scarves is fun!”
I’ll show her some eye-hand coordination. I’d like to coordinate my fist right
into her eye.
Chapter Eight
Ghost in the Graveyard
When I got to school the next week,
Ryan and Michael got to me as I was putting my backpack in my cubby.
“Check out you-know-who,” they said.
At the front of the classroom, Andrea
was juggling again. But she wasn’t juggling scarves this time. She was juggling
three apples! She had all of them up in
the air at the same time. If it had been
anybody else, I would have thought it
was cool.
Andrea caught the apples and put
them on Miss Daisy’s desk as a present.
What a little brownnoser!
“Thank you, Andrea!” Miss Daisy said.
“That was wonderful. How did you learn
to juggle?”
“I practiced at home like Miss Small
told us to,” Andrea said. “It’s easy!”
I hate her. She should go off and
become a juggling clown in the circus.
“Okay, everybody, it’s time to line up,”
Miss Daisy announced.
“Line up for what?”
“Fizz Ed!” Miss Daisy said.
“Yippee!” shouted all the girls.
“Boo!” shouted all the boys.
“I don’t feel very good, Miss Daisy,” I
said.
“What’s the matter, A.J.?” she asked.
“Do you have a tummy ache? A
headache?”
I really felt fine. I just didn’t want to go
to Fizz Ed. But I didn’t want to say that to
Miss Daisy. I didn’t know what to do. I
didn’t know what to say. I had to think fast.
“I think my tummy has a headache,” I
said, “or maybe it’s my head that has a
tummy ache.” Everybody laughed, even
though I didn’t say anything funny.
“I know a cure for that,” said Miss Daisy.
“Really?” I said.
“Sure. You’ll feel fine after an hour of
Fizz Ed.”
We walked the million hundred miles
to the gym. It was a really hot day, and I
was already tired when we got there.
“Is everybody ready to play a game?”
Miss Small asked. She was jumping up
and down with excitement, like some
little kid who never played a game before
in her life.
“What do you
think she’s gonna
have us do now,”
Ryan whispered to
me, “spin plates on
sticks?”
“I’ve got an idea
for a game,” I said,
remembering to
raise my hand.
“What game do
you want to play, A.J.?”
“How about chess?”
“Chess?” asked Miss Small. “Don’t you
want to play a game where you get to run
around and jump up and down and have
fun?”
“I’m a little tired of fun,” I said.
“Yeah, having fun is too much work,”
Ryan said.
“How about we have a contest to see
who can sit around and do nothing the
longest?” suggested Michael.
“Oh, no. We’re going to have lots of
fun today,” said Miss Small. “We’re going
to play a game called Ghost in the
Graveyard.”
“That sounds scary,” said that crybaby
Emily.
“It’s not scary at all,” Miss Small said.
“It’s fun! Let’s go out to the playground.”
So we all went out to the playground.
Miss Small told us that the swings would
be home base and that she would be the
ghost.
“I’m going to hide,” she said, “and you
have to find me. The person who spots
me yells ‘Ghost in the graveyard!’ and
everybody has to run back to home base
before I tag you. If I tag you before you
get back to the swings, you become a
ghost in the next round.”
We all covered our eyes, and Miss
Small ran off to hide.
“One o’clock rock,” we chanted. “Two
o’clock rock . . . three o’clock rock . . .
four o’clock rock . . .”
When we reached twelve o’clock, we
all shouted “Midnight!” and uncovered
our eyes.
“Where is she?” asked Michael. “I don’t
see her anywhere.”
“She’s hiding, silly!” Andrea said.
We looked all over for Miss Small. We
looked by the monkey bars. We looked
under the seesaw. We looked around the
soccer goals. We looked by the basketball hoops. Miss Small had vanished.
It was hot out. We were tired from all
that looking. We sat in the shade of a tree
to talk things over.
“Let me think,” Andrea said. “If I was
Miss Small, where would I be?”
“I played hide-and-seek with my dad
once,” Emily said. “I was looking for him
for about an hour. And you know where
I finally found him?”
“Where?” we asked.
“He was sitting on the couch in the
living room watching a football game on
TV.”
“Cool,” I said. “Who was playing?”
“Emily’s point is that hiding games are
just a way for grown-ups to pretend to play
with us,” Andrea explained. “They don’t
really want to play. All they really want to
do is sit around and do grown-up things.”
“Grown-ups are so boring,” I said.
“Miss Small is probably in the
teachers’ lounge,” Ryan said. “I bet she’s
having a cup of coffee and talking about
the weather or some other boring
grown-up thing.”
“Yeah!”
We were about to run to the teachers’
lounge when I heard a cracking noise. It
was almost like a creaking door in one of
those scary movies.
“What’s that?” I asked.
“What’s what?” Michael asked.
The sound was coming from above.
We all looked up. It was a big branch.
Not just a big branch. It was a big branch
with a person on it. And the person was
Miss Small!
“Watch out!” one of the girls screamed.
The branch with Miss Small on it was
coming down right on top of us! She was
screaming. So were we! We all dove out
of the way.
“Ooof!” Miss Small grunted when she
hit the ground.
“Ghost in the graveyard!” somebody
shouted. And we all ran back to home
base.
Chapter Nine
Fit as a Fiddle
Luckily for us, nobody got tagged by
Miss Small on the way back to home
base. Luckily for us, that is, but not so
lucky for Miss Small. She was still lying
there on the ground under the tree. So
we all ran back to her.
“Are you okay?” we all asked as we
gathered around her.
“My leg,” she moaned, and there was
pain all over her face.
That crybaby Emily started crying. So
did a few other kids. To be honest, I
almost felt like crying myself. But I
didn’t. Instead I ran to get our school
nurse, Mrs. Cooney.
Mrs. Cooney came running out of the
school with a first-aid kit.
“Oh, dear!” Mrs. Cooney said when
she saw Miss Small lying under the tree.
She got down on her hands and knees to
examine Miss Small.
“You should put a Band-Aid on her leg
and kiss it,” Michael told Mrs. Cooney.
“That’s what my mom does when I get
hurt.”
“Your mom is weird,” I told Michael.
“She’s going to need more than a BandAid and a kiss,” Mrs. Cooney told us.
“This leg is broken.”
Mrs. Cooney called for an ambulance
on her cell phone, and it arrived just a
couple of minutes later. Some guys got
out, and they put Miss Small on a
stretcher and carried it into the ambulance. We asked them to put their siren
on when they drove to the hospital, but
they wouldn’t. It was still cool anyway,
having an ambulance right on the playground.
As soon as we got back to class, we all
wrote get-well cards to Miss Small. They
must have worked, because just a few
days later, she was back at school. She
had a big cast on her leg and crutches to
help her walk. And she was smiling.
I thought Fizz Ed would be canceled
for a few weeks until Miss Small got
better. But the day after Miss Small was
back, Miss Daisy told us to line up for
Fizz Ed.
When we got to the gym, Miss Small
was standing there with her crutches,
waiting for us.
“I’m fit as a fiddle!” she said. “Let’s have
fun!”
Even though she was hobbling around,
Miss Small still wanted to play games. We
played some more Ghost in the
Graveyard, but nobody was allowed to
climb the tree this time. Miss Small also
taught us how to play Red Light Green
Light, Red Rover, Spud, London Bridge,
Mother May I, and this really cool game
called Duck Duck Goose.
I still wish we could have played basketball and football and baseball and
sports like that. But those corny games
Miss Small taught us were actually kind
of fun, I had to admit.
Maybe Fizz Ed wasn’t so bad after all.
Chapter Ten
Cooties and Clog Dancing
“Good morning, boys and girls,” Principal
Klutz said over the loudspeaker. “Today is
Tuesday, and today is special because our
own Miss Small is a quarter of a century
old! So if you see Miss Small in the hall,
be sure to wish her a happy birthday.”
“Wow!” Ryan whispered to me. “A
quarter of a century is a long time.”
After the morning announcements, we
have this thing in our class called Show
and Share. We have to bring in something
from home and tell the class about it.
I brought in an old army helmet that
my grandpa wore when he fought in a
war a long time ago. It has fake leaves
attached to it so Grandpa could hide in
the woods and nobody would see him. I
put it on my head even though it was too
big for me. Then everybody passed the
helmet around so they could feel how
heavy it was.
“That’s very interesting, A.J.,” Miss
Daisy said when I was finished. “It’s your
turn, Andrea. What do you have to share
with us today?”
“That helmet is awesome, A.J.,” Ryan
whispered to me while Andrea got up.
“Yeah, let’s see Andrea top that,” I said.
Andrea lugged a big duffel bag up to
the front of the class. She pulled three
long sticks out of the bag. On the end of
each stick was a thing that looked like a
marshmallow, but black. Then she
pulled out a lighter and set those marshmallow things on fire!
“My mom signed me up for juggling
lessons,” Andrea announced.
Then she threw those flaming sticks up
in the air! I don’t know how she did it,
but the sticks were flying all over the
place. She kept catching them and
throwing them back up in the air. If it
had been anybody else, I would have
thought it was super cool.
Finally Andrea caught all three sticks
in one hand, blew them out, and took a
bow. Everybody started cheering and
clapping. I hate her.
“After I get good,” Andrea said, “I’m
going to learn how to juggle while I’m
riding a unicycle.”
I hope she rides her unicycle off a cliff.
“Okay, everybody, it’s time to line up
for Fizz Ed!” Miss Daisy announced.
When we got to the gym, we sang
“Happy Birthday” to Miss Small and told
her she didn’t look half bad for somebody
who had lived a quarter of a century.
“Today we’re going to do something
that’s really fun!” Miss Small announced.
“Everybody choose a partner. We’re
going to have a three-legged race!”
“How can we have a three-legged race
when we only have two legs?” I asked.
Everybody laughed even though I
didn’t say anything funny. I turned
around to see if Ryan or Michael would
be my partner. But Ryan chose Michael,
and Michael chose Ryan.
Just about everybody had already
chosen a partner. There was only one kid
in the class besides me who didn’t have a
partner.
Andrea Young!
“Looks like we’re partners, A.J.,”
Andrea said.
“Okay,” I said. “But I’m not inviting
you to my birthday party or anything.”
“Don’t worry, I’m not inviting you to
my birthday party, either.”
“Good.”
Miss Small gave each team a piece of
rope. We tied my left ankle to Andrea’s
right ankle. I had no place to put my left
arm except around Andrea’s shoulders. It
was disgusting, but I had to do it.
“Hey, look!” Ryan said. “A.J. and
Andrea are in love!”
Everybody laughed.
“Shut up, Ryan,” I said.
“When are you gonna get married?”
asked Michael.
Some friends! My face was all hot, and
I would have beat up the two of them if I
hadn’t been tied to Andrea.
“A.J.,” Andrea whispered, “I know how
you can get back at Ryan and Michael.”
“How?”
“Let’s beat ’em!”
“Beat ’em?” I said. “Aren’t you the one
who said competing is icky?”
“I changed my mind,” she said. “Let’s
beat ’em! Let’s beat ’em bad! That will
show ’em!”
“We can’t beat ’em,” I told her.
“They’re the best athletes in second
grade. You’re a girl.”
“We can do it, A.J.!” Andrea said.
“Three-legged races are a lot like clog
dancing.”
“Clog dancing?” I asked. “Is that some
dance that plumbers do when the sink
gets clogged up?”
“No, silly. It’s a step dance that you do
with your heel keeping time with the
music. I go clogging every Thursday
after school.”
“I’m not doing any clogging. Clogging
is dumb.”
“You want to win, don’t you?” Andrea
said. “Look, all you have to do is move
your leg forward whenever I count to
two.”
“All right, all right,” I said.
I didn’t like the idea of Andrea Young
ordering me around. But what else was I
gonna do? Our legs were tied together.
Everybody lined up on the starting
line.
“To win a three-legged race, you need
cooties,” Miss Small said. “Cooperation.
Teamwork. Sportsmanship.”
“Let’s stomp ’em into the ground!”
Andrea whispered in my ear. “Let’s make
’em wish they were never born!”
“On your mark,” Miss Small hollered.
“Get set. Go!”
Me and Andrea took off.
“One . . . two . . . one . . . two . . .” Andrea
said, “one . . . two . . . one . . . two . . .”
Andrea and I went clogging down the
field. Some of the kids fell down. We
were in first place. Ryan and Michael
were right behind us.
“You’d make a great clogger, A.J.!”
Andrea shouted.
“Quiet, I’m trying to concentrate!”
“One . . . two . . . one . . . two . . .”
Me and Andrea were out in front of
everyone.
“One . . . two . . . one . . . two . . .”
Me and Andrea were pulling away
from everybody else!
“One . . . two . . . one . . . two . . .”
Michael and Ryan fell down!
“One . . . two . . . one . . . two . . .”
Me and Andrea won the race!
“Ha-ha!” I called to Ryan and Michael.
“Eat my dust, losers!”
I was so happy that I almost wanted to
give Andrea a hug.
Almost.
Chapter Eleven
Grown-ups Are Weird
Recess is the best time of the day because
that’s when we get to go out on the playground while the teachers do all the
boring things grown-ups do when kids
aren’t around.
Lately Andrea was practicing her juggling during recess. She put on her dumb
show, and kids in the other classes would
gather around and watch. Like she was
famous or something.
But today Andrea wasn’t juggling. She
and Emily were just sitting on the
monkey bars looking all serious, like the
world was about to end. Me and Michael
and Ryan couldn’t resist going over to
bug them.
“What’s the matter with you?” I asked
Andrea. “Did you set your house on fire
while you were juggling?”
“No,” she said, “we’re worried about
Miss Small.”
“What about her?” asked Ryan.
“We’re afraid she might die,” Emily said.
“What!” I said. “You’re nuts! All she did
was break her leg.”
“Miss Small is a quarter of a century
old,” Andrea said. “That’s like, ancient.
Old ladies aren’t supposed to run
around and jump up and down and play
games all the time. Old people are supposed to sit around talking about the
weather and eating and reading the
newspaper and complaining about the
kids today and telling us to be quiet.
Miss Small doesn’t do any of those
things. She’s like a big kid. She grew
tall, but she never grew up.”
“My dad is a doctor,” said Emily. “He
told me that when old people fall down,
they can get hurt really badly. They can
even die.”
Wow. I didn’t know that.
“If Miss Small dies, it will be our fault,”
Andrea said.
For a while nobody said anything.
Maybe Andrea was right, for once in her
life.
“We’ve got to do something,” said
Emily.
“We should talk to her,” Andrea said.
“We need to tell her she has to grow up
and act mature like other adults.”
So all of us—me, Michael, Ryan, Andrea,
and Emily—went around the school to the
gym. We figured that’s where Miss Small
would be during recess.
“Shh!” Andrea said as we snuck around
the corner. “If Principal Klutz catches us,
we could be in big trouble.”
Me and Michael and Ryan got down on
our hands and knees and pretended to be
undercover agents on a secret police mission. It was cool.
Finally we reached the back door to the
gym.
“We may have to pick the lock like
they always do in police movies,” Ryan
whispered. “Then they run inside and
shout, ‘Freeze, dirtbags!’”
“No,” Michael said, “in the movies they
kick the door in with their feet and
shout, ‘Freeze, dirtbags!’”
“No, they don’t,” I told them. “They
use bombs to blow the door off the
hinges. Then they run inside and shout,
‘Freeze, dirtbags!’”
“Maybe the door isn’t even locked,”
Emily said.
“The door is always locked, dumbhead,” I said. “Why else would they have
to blow it off the hinges?”
Andrea put her hand on the doorknob
and turned it. And you know what? The
door opened!
Me and Michael and Ryan ran inside
the gym, just like they do in all the police
movies.
“Freeze, dirtbags!” we shouted.
And there, in the gym, was the most
amazing sight any of us had ever seen.
All the grown-ups who work in the
school were there. Every one of them!
And they were going crazy!
Mr. Klutz, the principal, was doing the
Chicken Dance. Our teacher, Miss Daisy,
was playing hopscotch. Mrs. Roopy, our
librarian, was hula hooping. Ms.
Hannah, our art teacher, was jumping
rope. Miss Small was clapping her hands
and singing that annoying hillbilly
music. All the other teachers were doing
the limbo and other equally weird stuff.
They all stopped what they were doing
and stared at me and Michael and Ryan.
“What are you doing here, boys?” Miss
Small asked.
“Uh . . .”
I looked at Ryan and Michael. They
were doing that whistling thing you do
when you want to pretend you didn’t
do anything wrong. I didn’t know what
to do. I didn’t know what to say. I had to
think fast.
“The question is, what are you doing
here?” I asked. “Why aren’t you all sitting
around talking about the weather and
eating and drinking coffee and reading
the newspaper and doing other grown-up
stuff?”
“We’re having fun!” Mr. Klutz said.
“Why should you kids have all the
fun?” said Miss Daisy.
“Yeah, we want to play too,” Mrs.
Roopy said.
“This is the only time we have all day
to relax,” said Ms. Hannah.
“Yeah!” said all the other grown-ups.
“Lighten up.”
Grown-ups are weird.
Me and Michael and Ryan ran out of
there as fast as we could and went back
to the playground. I hoped that Miss
Daisy wouldn’t tell my mom and dad that
I called all the grown-ups at our school
dirtbags.
Back on the playground, we decided
that Miss Small really does have a serious
problem. And now it’s spreading to all
the other teachers. Somehow, we’re
gonna have to think of a way to make
Miss Small grow up and act mature and
boring like a normal adult.
But it won’t be easy!
