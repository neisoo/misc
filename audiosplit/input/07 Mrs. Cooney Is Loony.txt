Mrs. Cooney Is Loony

Chapter One
I Was a Genius!
My name is A.J. and I hate school.
The worst part about second grade is
math. I don’t get it. If we have calculators,
why do we need to learn math? That’s
like walking to school when you could
ride your bike. It makes no sense, if you
ask me.
“Who can tell me what two times ten
equals?” asked my teacher, Miss Daisy.
A few kids raised their hands. I didn’t.
Miss Daisy called on this crybaby girl
Emily, who has red hair.
“Miss Daisy, I don’t feel very well,”
Emily said. “Can I go to the nurse’s
office?”
“Rest your head on your desk for a few
minutes, Emily,” said Miss Daisy. “If you
don’t feel better, you can go see Mrs.
Cooney.”
Emily put her head on her desk.
“Now who can tell me what two times
ten equals?” Miss Daisy asked again.
“A.J.?”
I had no idea what two times ten
equalled. I didn’t know what to say. I
didn’t know what to do. I had to think
fast.
I knew that two plus two is four. And I
knew that two times two is also four. So I
knew that addition and multiplication
were pretty much the same thing.
I also knew that two plus ten equals
twelve. So two times ten must equal
twelve too.
“Twelve?” I guessed.
“Sorry, A.J.,” said Miss Daisy.
“Oooh, I know!” said Andrea Young,
this really annoying girl with curly brown
hair. She was waving her hand back and
forth like it was on fire. “Call on me, Miss
Daisy. Please?”
Andrea thinks she knows everything. I
wish I could punch her.
But nah-nah-nah boo-boo on her,
because Andrea didn’t get the chance to
answer. At that very moment, the most
amazing thing in the history of the world
happened.
Emily got up from her seat really fast.
She ran to the window.
And then she threw up!
It was cool. Me and my friends Michael
and Ryan looked at each other and tried
not to laugh. I was glad that I wasn’t
walking under that window when Emily
threw up.
After she finished puking her guts out,
Emily ran out of the room crying.
“Go to Mrs. Cooney’s office, Emily!”
Miss Daisy yelled to her. Then Miss Daisy
went to the intercom and told Mrs.
Cooney that Emily was on her way down
there.
It took a few minutes for all of us to
stop talking about what had happened.
I mean, it wasn’t every day that a kid
tossed her cookies out the window. I was
sure Miss Daisy would forget all about
math after that.
But no way.
“Now, A.J., try to figure it out,” Miss
Daisy said. “Two times ten. Two tens. We
went over this. Think hard.”
So I thought hard. I thought and I
thought and I thought.
This is what I thought—Emily is going
to get to go home. She doesn’t have to sit
through math. That lucky stiff.
My friend Billy around the corner who
was in second grade last year told me
about this kid in his class who got to go
home from school after he sneezed with
his eyes open and his eyeballs fell out.
Right out of his head!
I wasn’t sure if that was true, but I did
know one thing. If you get sick, you get
to go home. I didn’t want my eyeballs to
fall out of my head, but I wanted to go
home. I wanted to get out of math.
I started moaning.
“A.J., are you okay?” asked Miss Daisy.
“I don’t feel well,” I said. “I think I
might have to throw
up out the window. I
think I’m gonna die.”
“There must be
something going
around,” said Miss
Daisy. “Go to Mrs.
Cooney’s office! And
hurry!”
All right!
I was a genius! On my way out of the
class, I winked at Ryan and Michael.
“So long, suckers!” I whispered. “Have
fun in math!”
I had been to the nurse’s office a few
times before. Once I fell off the monkey
bars in the playground and landed on my
head. I had to go to the hospital and
everything. It was cool. The doctor took
an X-ray of my brain, but he told me he
didn’t find anything. Then he laughed
even though he didn’t say anything
funny.
Getting out of math wasn’t the only
reason I wanted to go to Mrs. Cooney’s
office. There was another reason.
But I can’t tell you what it is.
I shouldn’t be telling you.
Okay, I’ll tell you. But you have to
promise not to tell anybody else or you’re
going to die as soon as the words leave
your lips.
Here it is.
Mrs. Cooney is the most beautiful lady
in the history of the world.

Chapter Two
Mrs. Cooney Is Loony!
“Good morning, A.J.,” Mrs. Cooney said
when I walked into the nurse’s office. She
has a really soft voice that you can barely
hear. “Miss Daisy told me you might be
sick.”
I was sick. Sick of math. But I didn’t tell
Mrs. Cooney that.
“I think I have a headache,” I lied.
Mrs. Cooney has really pretty straight
brown hair and blue eyes that look like
the color of cotton candy yogurt. The
kind with no sprinkles. And she was
wearing a white nurse’s uniform. And she
is beautiful.
You want to know how beautiful Mrs.
Cooney is? She looks like this famous
movie star who I can’t remember her
name. But every time my mom sees a picture of this movie star, she asks my dad if
he thinks she’s pretty. And my dad says
no, of course not. Then my mom gets
mad. Then my dad spends like an hour
trying to convince my mom that my
mom is just as pretty as the movie star.
Mrs. Cooney is even prettier than that
movie star.
I decided that I didn’t want to go home
anymore. I wanted to stay in the nurse’s
office with Mrs. Cooney.
“Do you want to go home, A.J.?” asked
Mrs. Cooney. “Emily’s mom just picked
her up. I hope you don’t have what she
has.”
“Uh, no,” I said. “I feel a lot better now.”
“Well, if you feel better, you can go
back to class,” Mrs. Cooney said.
“Can I stay here for a while?” I asked.
“Just in case I might have to throw up?”
“Okay,” said Mrs. Cooney. “Sit down on
the couch, A.J.”
There were about a million hundred
Beanie Babies all over the couch. I sat
down on it. Mrs. Cooney asked me what
I had for breakfast, what time I went to
sleep last night, what I was allergic to,
and a bunch of other questions. She
sure is a curious lady!
Next to the couch, on the wall, there
was this poster. It was a cartoon showing
a kid who got some food caught in his
throat. He’s choking. So this other kid
comes over and grabs him from behind
and whacks him in the stomach. The
food goes flying out of the first kid’s
mouth.
It was a cool cartoon.
“A.J., I have a cure for your headache,”
Mrs. Cooney said. “Take this yardstick. I
want you to balance it on your nose.”
“Huh? Why would that help my
headache?” I asked.
“A.J., I’m a trained nurse,” Mrs. Cooney
said. “I know what I’m doing.”
I took the yardstick and balanced it on
my nose.
“Like this?” I asked.
“Very good,” Mrs. Cooney said. “Now I
want you to get up and hop on one foot
while you keep balancing the yardstick.”
“What will that do?” I asked.
“I’m a trained nurse!” Mrs. Cooney said.
“Just do it.”
So I got up and hopped on one foot
with the yardstick on my nose.
“Does your head feel better now?” she
asked.
“A little, I guess.”
I didn’t want to say I was better,
because she would send me back to class.
“Good,” Mrs. Cooney said. “Now while
you do that, I want you to cluck like a
chicken.”
“Huh?” I asked.
“Just cluck!”
So I clucked like a chicken while I
hopped on one foot and balanced the
yardstick on my nose. It wasn’t really fun
at all. It was hard to do!
“How do you feel now, A.J.?” Mrs.
Cooney asked.
“I think maybe I’m all better,” I said.
“Good. See, I told you I had a cure,”
said Mrs. Cooney. “There must be something going around. First Emily, and then
you. That’s two sick kids right there. If
two kids at the middle school got sick, do
you know how many that would be?”
“Four kids,” I said.
“And what if two kids at the high
school got sick too?” Mrs. Cooney asked.
“How many would that be?”
I counted on my fingers.
“Six kids,” I said.
“That’s a lot of sick kids!” said Mrs.
Cooney. “And what if two kids at ten different schools all got sick at the same
time?”
I thought it over. I counted on my fingers. And then I realized something.
“Hey, this sounds a lot like math!” I
said. “Are you trying to make me do
multiplication?”
“Why would I do that?” Mrs. Cooney
asked. “I’m a trained nurse. Now, just to
make sure you are all better, I’d like you
to blow up this balloon, rub it on your
head, and sing ‘Who Stole the Cookie
from the Cookie Jar?’”
Ugh. I hate that song.
“I feel fine now, Mrs. Cooney,” I said. “I
think I’d better get back to class. Thank
you.”
“Happy to be of service,” she said.
Mrs. Cooney sure was weird. But as I
walked out of the nurse’s office, I realized
something else.
When I grow up, I want to marry Mrs.
Cooney.

Chapter Three
My Big Decision
“She made you balance a yardstick on
your nose?” Ryan asked. He couldn’t
believe it.
“I had to cluck like a chicken, too,” I
said.
“Mrs. Cooney is loony!” said Michael.
We were sitting around the vomitorium
eating lunch. I gave Ryan my disgusting
applesauce and he gave me his cupcake.
Ryan will eat anything.
Ryan and Michael told me that after
math was over, Miss Daisy taught the
class about vowels.
“Vowels are the letters a, e, i, o, and u,”
Michael told me.
“I thought vowels were e, i, e, i, o,” I
said. “Like in ‘Old MacDonald Had a
Farm.’”
“Sometimes y is a vowel,” added Ryan.
“Sometimes?” I asked. “Well, is y a
vowel or isn’t it?”
“Sometimes it is, and sometimes it
isn’t,” Michael said.
“I think y should make up its mind,” I
said.
It was time to clean off our table. It was
also time for me to tell the guys about my
big decision. I had been thinking about it
all during lunch. I was thinking about it
so much I could barely enjoy Ryan’s cupcake.
“Guys,” I said. “You’re my best friends,
so I have to let you in on a secret.
Promise not to tell anyone?”
“Promise,” promised Ryan and Michael.
“When I grow up,” I said, “I’m gonna
marry Mrs. Cooney.”
“Oooh!” Ryan shouted. “A.J. and Mrs.
Cooney are in love!”
“Shut up!” I said. “You promised!”
“A.J., girls have cooties!” Michael said.
“Everybody knows that.”
“Only little girls have cooties,” I told
him. “Grown-up girls don’t have cooties.
And even if they did, I’m sure Mrs.
Cooney has a cootie cure. She is a trained
nurse, you know.”
I never should have told Ryan and
Michael my big news.
“Maybe Mrs. Cooney will want to
marry me,” Ryan said.
“Hey, I thought of marrying her first,” I
said.
“Maybe she’ll marry all of us,” said
Michael.
Suddenly, at the next table, Miss
Smarty-Pants Know-It-All Who Should
Have an Elevator Fall on Her Head
turned around.
“You silly dumbheads,” Andrea said.
“Mrs. Cooney is already married!”
“What?” we all said. “How do you
know?”
“That’s why she’s called Mrs. Cooney!”
Andrea said. “If she
wasn’t married, she’d
be called Miss Cooney.”
Andrea thinks she
knows so much. And
now she knows I’m in
love with Mrs. Cooney. I wish I could
punch her.
As we scraped our trays into the
garbage can, Ryan and Michael decided
that they would marry Mrs. Cooney even
if she was already married. They said that
they were going to pretend to be sick so
they could go see Mrs. Cooney too.
“Hey, that was my idea!” I complained.
“It was a good idea,” said Michael.
“It’s not fair!” I said.
“It is too,” said Ryan.
As it turned out, none of us had to pretend to be sick and go see Mrs. Cooney.
“Clear off your desks,” said Miss Daisy
when we got back to class. “Mrs. Cooney
is coming to talk to us.”
All right!

Chapter Four
The Last Straw
Miss Daisy told us to be on our best
behavior while she called Mrs. Cooney
on the intercom. So as soon as she turned
her back on the class, me and Michael
got up and shook our butts.
Finally, after about a million hundred
minutes of waiting, Mrs. Cooney walked
in the door.
“Va-va-va-voom!” I whispered to
Michael, who sits next to me.
I really don’t know what “va-va-vavoom” means, but that’s what my dad
always says when he sees a picture of
that movie star who looks like Mrs.
Cooney.
“I’m in love,” Michael said.
“Me too,” said Ryan, who was sitting
behind me.
“Me three,” I said.
It was bad enough that Mrs. Cooney
had a husband. Now Michael and Ryan
were in love with her too! How would I
ever get Mrs. Cooney to marry me
instead of all those other guys?
My friend Billy around the corner
knows a lot about girls. He says the way
to get a girl to like you is to
make her laugh. So I
decided that I would try
that.
“What are you going
to teach us today,
Mrs. Cooney?” asked
Miss Daisy.
“Today we’re going
to learn about nutrition,” said Mrs. Cooney.
“Does anybody know
what a food pyramid is?”
“Sure,” I said. “That’s
what they eat in Egypt.”
Some of the kids laughed, but Mrs.
Cooney didn’t. I would have to try
harder.
“Please raise your hand instead of
shouting out,” said Mrs. Cooney.
“Andrea?”
“The food pyramid shows the groups of
foods that make up a good diet,” Andrea
said.
“Good, Andrea,” said Mrs. Cooney as
she held up a big poster of a pyramid
with food all over it. She gave Andrea a
smiley face sticker for her notebook.
Andrea has so many smiley face stickers
on her notebook that you can hardly see
the notebook anymore.
“Can anyone name all the food
groups?” asked Mrs. Cooney.
This time I raised my hand, and Mrs.
Cooney called on me.
“The refrigerator, the freezer, the
pantry, and the kitchen cabinets,” I said.
“That’s where we group the food in my
house.”
A few kids laughed. Mrs. Cooney
crossed her arms in front of her and
tapped her foot until the laughing died
down. She had on her serious face. She’s
cute when she’s serious.
“Not exactly,” she said. Andrea had her
hand in the air, as usual, and she got
called on. Andrea named all the dumb
food groups and got another smiley face
sticker.
Why doesn’t a food pyramid fall on
Andrea’s head? I wish I could punch her.
“Good,” said Mrs. Cooney. “Kids, where
you eat may be as important as what you
eat. Tell me, where do you usually eat
your meals?”
“In my mouth,” I said. “Where else
would I eat my meals?”
“No, I mean, do you eat in your
kitchen?” Mrs. Cooney asked. “Do you eat
in the car? Do you usually eat in front of
the TV?”
“We eat all our meals in front of the
TV,” I said.
“Why, A.J.?” asked Mrs. Cooney.
“Because there’s no room behind the
TV,” I said. “We’d be squished.”
All the kids laughed. Mrs. Cooney put
her hands on her hips and wrinkled up
her forehead at me. But she still wasn’t
laughing. Maybe she was in a bad mood.
“Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day,” Mrs. Cooney said. “You can’t
do good work at school if you haven’t
eaten a good breakfast. That goes for
grown-ups, too. For example, it’s hard for
me to work on an empty stomach.”
“You shouldn’t work on an empty
stomach, Mrs. Cooney,” I said. “You
should work on your desk.”
Everybody laughed at that one. Mrs.
Cooney slapped her own forehead, like
there was a bug on it.
“A.J.,” said Mrs. Cooney. “Can you
please try not to shout things out? Now
how many of you eat breakfast in your
pajamas?”
“That’s disgusting!” I said. “My mom
puts my breakfast on a plate.”
“A.J.! Go sit in the hall!” Mrs. Cooney
said. “That’s the last straw!”
What did straws have to do with anything? She wasn’t even talking about
straws.
Why are grown-ups constantly running out of straws? I offered to bring
some more straws from home, but Mrs.
Cooney said she didn’t want them.
“Nah-nah-nah boo-boo,” Michael whispered when I went to sit in the hall.
I was in love with Mrs. Cooney, but she
sure wasn’t in love with me.

Chapter Five
Checking for Headlights
To make Mrs. Cooney fall in love with me,
I would have to be on my best behavior.
Luckily I got my chance the very next day.
After we finished pledging the allegiance, Miss Daisy told the class that we
had to go to Mrs. Cooney’s office one at a
time. Ryan and Michael wanted to go
first. But I got to go first because my
name starts with a.
So nah-nah-nah boo-boo on them.
When I got to Mrs. Cooney’s office, she
didn’t seem mad at me anymore. I was
determined to be the most perfect kid in
the history of the world.
“Good morning, A.J.,” Mrs. Cooney said.
“Every year at this time, I have to check
the students for headlights.”
Headlights? Why would a kid bring a
headlight to school? Headlights belong
on cars. I kept my mouth shut, though. I
didn’t want Mrs. Cooney to get mad at
me again.
Mrs. Cooney put on a pair of rubber
gloves. She told me to sit on a chair, and
she turned on a bright light over the chair.
It was like one of those lights they shine at
bad guys in police TV shows when they’re
trying to get them to confess.
I wanted to tell Mrs. Cooney that checking kids for headlights was dopey, but I
was trying to be on my best behavior.
“Is this really necessary?” I asked
politely.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” she
said. “Lots of kids have headlights.”
Nobody I know! Mrs. Cooney started
looking through my hair and rubbing a
stick against my head. What a waste of
time! If I had a headlight up there, she
wouldn’t have to look very hard to see it.
“What happens if I have one?” I asked.
“You’ll have to stay home from school
for a few days,” Mrs. Cooney said.
Hmm, that didn’t sound like such a
bad idea. I could use a vacation. I started
thinking of how I could get a headlight.
Maybe my dad had an extra one in the
garage.
But even if I could get a headlight, how
would I attach it to my head? With a strap
or something?
As Mrs. Cooney was poking around
in my hair, I started to think about what
it would be like if the two of us were married. Maybe she would make me hop
around the
house with
a ruler on
my nose and
cluck like a
chicken all day.
Maybe I would
have to wear a
headlight all the
time.
My mom once
told me that all
people are different
and that’s what makes
people so interesting. She said we should
accept people for who they are instead of
trying to change them. Maybe I could
live with Mrs. Cooney even if she was
weird.
“Okay,” Mrs. Cooney said. “You can go
back to class, A.J. You don’t have headlights.”
Duh!
Mrs. Cooney is weird, but I still loved
her. I decided that I still wanted to marry
her when I grow up.
When I got back to class, I told Ryan
and Michael that Mrs. Cooney tried to
find headlights in my hair.
“It’s head lice, dumbhead!” Michael
said. “Not headlights!”
Oh. That explained a lot.

Chapter Six
Ryan and Michael Go to the Nurse
Luckily, nobody in our class had head lice
or headlights. But the next day Ryan and
Michael sounded horribly sick.
“Cough, cough, cough,” coughed Ryan.
Michael made weird nose noises and held
his neck with both hands.
“Is something the matter, boys?” asked
Miss Daisy.
“I have a sore throat,” said Michael.
“Me too,” said Ryan, coughing some
more, “and a tummy ache. May I go to the
nurse’s office?”
Miss Daisy looked
at them for a
minute, like she
wasn’t sure if she
believed them.
“Well, okay,” she
said. Then she called Mrs. Cooney to tell
her Ryan and Michael were on their way.
“So long, sucker!” Ryan whispered to
me as he was leaving. “Have fun learning
about vowels.”
Miss Daisy told us about vowels and
consonants. Consonants are all the letters
that aren’t vowels. They should be called
un-vowels or anti-vowels, if you ask me.
“How come y is sometimes a vowel and
sometimes a consonant?” I asked Miss
Daisy.
“I have no idea,” she said. Miss Daisy
doesn’t know anything about anything.
When Michael and Ryan finally came
back to class, it was time for lunch. We
found our usual table in the vomitorium.
“Mrs. Cooney is weird!” said Michael.
“You can say that again!” said Ryan.
Michael said that when he told Mrs.
Cooney he had a sore throat, she didn’t
give him cough medicine or take his temperature or anything. She had him stand
in a big cardboard box and try to wiggle
his ears.
“How would that cure a sore throat?” I
asked.
“Beats me,” said Michael.
Ryan said that when he told Mrs.
Cooney he had a tummy ache, she had
him bounce a balloon on his head while
he tried to sing the ABC song backward.
“How would that cure a tummy ache?”
I asked.
“Beats me,” said Ryan.
“Then she had me do push-ups on
bubble wrap,” Michael said.
“Then she had me solve math problems while I was doing jumping jacks,”
said Ryan.
“Then she put an ice pack on my head,”
Michael said. “Only she ran out of ice
packs, so she put a bag of frozen peas and
carrots on my head.”
“So did it work?” I asked.
“Did what work?” Michael asked.
“All that stuff Mrs. Cooney had you
do,” I said. “Did it make you feel better?”
“We weren’t really sick, dumbhead!”
Michael said. “We were just faking it so
we could go see Mrs. Cooney!”
I knew that.
Ryan and Michael also said Mrs.
Cooney gave them homework. They had
to go home and lick their elbows.
“What?” I asked.
“She said that if you can lick your
elbow, it will make any sickness go away,”
Ryan said.
I tried to lick my elbow, but I couldn’t
reach it. Michael and Ryan tried to lick
their elbows too. They couldn’t reach
either. Everybody in the vomitorium
must have seen us, because soon the
whole school was trying to lick their
elbows.
It was cool.

Chapter Seven
The Truth About Mrs. Cooney
It was recess the next day. Me and Ryan
and Michael were playing on the monkey
bars when Andrea and her little study
buddy Emily came over, like we were
friends or something.
“I know what you boys are up to,”
Andrea said. “None of you has been
sick. You just want to go to the nurse’s
office because you’re in love with Mrs.
Cooney.”
“That’s a lie!” I lied.
Why does Andrea have to know everything? And why doesn’t a garbage truck
fall on her head?
“Mrs. Cooney is busy enough with kids
who are really sick,” Andrea said. “She
doesn’t have time for fakers.”
“It’s none of your business, Andrea,” I
said.
“My mother is vice president of the
PTA,” Andrea said. “She could get you
kicked out of school for pretending to be
sick.”
“Yeah,” said Emily, who agrees with
everything Andrea says. “You’re not sick.
You’re just in love with Mrs. Cooney.”
“Well, I was in love with Mrs. Cooney,”
Ryan said, “but not anymore.”
“What?!” said me and Michael.
“Mrs. Cooney is too weird,” said Ryan.
“I couldn’t marry her.”
“What’s weird about her?” asked
Andrea.
We told Andrea about all the strange
things Mrs. Cooney did. I told her that
Mrs. Cooney had me hop on one foot and
cluck like a chicken while balancing a
ruler on my nose.
Michael told Andrea that Mrs. Cooney
had him stand in a cardboard box and try
to wiggle his ears.
Ryan told Andrea that Mrs. Cooney
had him bounce a balloon on his head
while he tried to sing the ABC song backward.
“And she put a bag of frozen veggies on
my head,” added Michael.
Well, Andrea and Emily were shocked!
They couldn’t believe it.
“That’s not what nurses are supposed
to do!” said Emily. “They’re supposed to
take your temperature and give you
medicine to help you feel better.”
“Maybe Mrs. Cooney isn’t a nurse at
all,” Michael said. “Did you ever think of
that?”
“What do you mean?” asked Emily,
looking all worried.
“Maybe she’s a fake nurse,” said
Michael. “Maybe she kidnapped the real
Mrs. Cooney and locked her up in an
airplane hangar somewhere.”
“Stuff like that happens all the time,
you know,” I added.
Andrea sat down on a swing and rested
her chin on her
hands.
“I’ve been giving this a lot of
thought,” she said.
“People are not
always who they
seem to be. I hate
to say this, but I’ve
come to the con-
clusion that Mrs. Cooney is no nurse.”
“So what is she?” Emily asked.
“I have reason to believe,” Andrea said,
“that Mrs. Cooney is a . . . spy.”
We all gasped.
“A spy?” asked Michael.
“You’re talking about the woman I
love!” I said.
Andrea got up and paced back and
forth from the swings to the seesaw. She
looked like one of those detectives in a
police movie.
“Think about it,” she said. “Mrs.
Cooney is always gathering information
on everybody. That’s what spies do. She
talks in a whisper, like she doesn’t want
anyone to hear her secrets. And she
always wears that nurse’s uniform.”
“So?” Michael asked.
“School nurses don’t wear nurse’s uniforms!” Andrea said. “They wear regular
clothes like everybody else.”
“Wait a minute,” I said. “You’re saying
that Mrs. Cooney can’t be a real nurse
because she wears a nurse’s uniform?”
“Exactly!” Andrea said. “It’s the perfect
disguise!”
“I don’t believe it,” I said.
“A.J., you’re blinded by love,” Andrea
said. “Mrs. Cooney probably came to our
school to spy on us, and she’s going to
sell the information to some bad guy
who’s going to try to take over the
world.”
“We’ve got to do something!” said
Emily, and she went running off the playground.
“You don’t know anything about
spies,” Ryan told Andrea. “I’ve seen lots
of spy movies. Spies always wear trench
coats and carry briefcases and drive cool
cars. They’re always slinking around in
the dark and looking in file cabinets.
And they’ve got all kinds of cool spy
gadgets.”
Michael was right. I’ve seen a lot of spy
movies too.
“You watch her,” Andrea said. “You’ll
see I’m right.”
It was hard to believe that Mrs. Cooney
might really be a spy. But after all, Andrea
is a genius who knows everything. She’s
right about everything else. Maybe she
was right about this, too.

Chapter Eight
Spying on a Spy
We decided the only way to find out if
Mrs. Cooney was really a spy would be to
spy on her.
So we watched her like a hawk the
whole next day. Andrea listened to Mrs.
Cooney’s conversations whenever she
talked with the teachers. Me and Ryan
snuck in the nurse’s office during recess.
Emily pretended to be sick so she could
gather more information.
Finally, when school let out at three
o’clock, we got together at the monkey
bars in the playground to compare notes.
“There’s a cabinet in the nurse’s office
that’s locked at all times,” Emily said, “and
I saw the word ‘poison’ on a bottle
inside!”
“Poison!” Michael said. “Spies are
always poisoning people!”
“And she took my temperature with
that weird thing she sticks in your ear,”
said Emily.
“How do we know that thing is really a
thermometer?” asked Ryan. “Maybe it’s a
secret brain scope.”
“She has all kinds of spy gadgets,” said
Ryan. “Like those machines she uses to
test our eyesight and hearing every year.
Maybe she really uses them to transmit
secret coded messages.”
“What about that tape measure thing
she’s got?” I asked. “The one where she
pushes a button and the whole tape goes
flying into her hand. That thing is cool.”
“Mrs. Cooney is always weighing and
measuring things,” Emily said.
“She’s obsessed,” said Andrea. “She’s
constantly gathering information about
us and writing it all down.”
“Like a spy,” Michael added.
“You know, when I was in her office
today,” Emily said, “she told me she isn’t
allowed to give kids medicine.”
“That’s true,” Michael said. “She’ll give
you a cough drop or some crackers.
That’s it.”
“Once she had me gargle with salt
water,” Ryan said. “A lot of good that did.”
“Or she’ll put a bag of frozen vegetables on your head,” said Michael.
“What kind of nurse can’t give medicine?” Emily asked.
“A fake one,” Michael said. “A spy
nurse.”
“This morning I saw her standing in
the hallway,” Andrea said, “and she was
whispering into the phone.”
“She was probably passing secrets to
that bad guy who wants to take over the
world,” said Ryan.
Wow, the evidence against Mrs.
Cooney was mounting. Maybe she really
was a spy!
“We’ve got to do something!” Emily
said.

Chapter Nine
Vowel Movements and the Third Degree
I was all mixed up. I was in love with Mrs.
Cooney and wanted to grow up and
marry her. But what if she was secretly a
spy who was selling information to some
guy who wanted to take over the world?
I was starting to feel sick. I mean really
sick. Not fake sick.
“A.J., you don’t look good,” Miss Daisy
said. “Do you need to go to the nurse’s
office?”
“No!” I said. “Not that! I’m fine.”
“A.J., I want you to go to the nurse’s
office,” Miss Daisy said. “Now.”
So I went to Mrs.
Cooney’s office.
“Hi, A.J.,” she said
cheerfully. “Feeling
a little under the
weather?”
“No. I feel fine,” I
said. “Can I go back
to class?”
“Not so fast.”
Oh no. She was going to have me stand
on my head or juggle Ping-Pong balls or
put her Beanie Babies in ABC order. Or
something equally weird.
“I want to ask you a few questions,”
said Mrs. Cooney. “When was your last
bowel movement?”
Huh? I didn’t quite hear what she said.
Bowel movement? What’s that? I didn’t
know what a bowel was, so how could I
possibly know if it moved? I didn’t want
Mrs. Cooney to know that I didn’t know
what a bowel movement was.
Maybe she said “vowel movement.”
That would make more sense. Vowels
move all the time. But I didn’t know
which vowel she was talking about.
“A?” I guessed.
“I said when was your last bowel movement?” Mrs. Cooney asked.
“Y?” I asked.
“Why?” said Mrs. Cooney. “Because
that will help me know what’s wrong
with you.”
I didn’t know what vowels had to do
with what was wrong with me.
“I-O-U,” I said.
“You owe me what?” Mrs. Cooney
asked. “A.J., can you please just answer
my questions? What did you have for
breakfast today?”
That’s when it hit me. Mrs. Cooney was
doing what all those cops do with bad
guys. She was giving me the third degree.
What if I told her some important piece
of top secret information? And what if
she sold it to that bad guy who wants to
take over the world? And what if that guy
took over the world?
It would be my fault!
The fate of the whole world was on my
shoulders!
I decided that I wasn’t going to give
Mrs. Cooney any information. I didn’t
care how beautiful she was. I wouldn’t
answer any of her questions, even if she
shined that head lice light in my eyes.
“A.J., did you eat breakfast this
morning?” Mrs. Cooney asked.
“That’s for me to know and you to find
out,” I said, crossing my arms in front of
me.
“I beg your pardon?” Mrs. Cooney said.
“I have the right to remain silent,” I said.
“A.J., I only asked you if you ate
breakfast.”
“That’s classified information,” I
replied. “Who wants to know? I want a
lawyer.”
“Don’t be silly, A.J.”
“Are you going to torture me?” I asked.
“That’s what they do in the movies.”
“A.J., you’re acting very strangely
today,” Mrs. Cooney said.
Oh, she thinks I’m strange! She puts
bags of frozen vegetables on kids’ heads
and makes them balance yardsticks. But
I’m strange!
By the time Mrs. Cooney let me go
back to class, school was over. All the
kids were gone. Miss Daisy gave me my
backpack and told me what we had to do
for homework.
But that night I couldn’t do my homework. I had too much on my mind.
I hate to admit that Andrea is right
about anything, but she just might be
right about Mrs. Cooney. What if she
really is a spy? How could I marry her?
And yet, she was so beautiful.
All night long I was tossing and turning
in my bed.

Chapter Ten
I Thought She Was Gonna Die
“Now are you convinced, A.J.?” Andrea
asked, taking a big bite of her apple.
Me and Ryan and Michael were sitting
around the vomitorium talking about
Mrs. Cooney. It was so important that we
even let Andrea and Emily sit at our
table.
All the evidence seemed to show that
Mrs. Cooney was a spy. Still, I wasn’t sure.
“My mom says people are innocent
until they’re proven guilty,” I said.
“Mrs. Cooney is guilty, A.J.!” Andrea
said, getting up and waving her arms
around. “What do you need to do, catch
her—”
But Andrea couldn’t finish that sentence, because at that very moment, the
most amazing thing in the history of the
world happened.
Andrea started choking.
“What’s the matter?” Emily asked.
Andrea couldn’t talk. She was gagging.
“She’s got something caught in her
throat!” Ryan said.
We all looked at the half-eaten apple in
Andrea’s hand. She was gasping, trying to
breathe. I looked at Ryan. Ryan looked at
Michael. Michael looked at Emily. Andrea
dropped the apple.
“We’ve got to do something!” shouted
Emily, and she went running out of the
vomitorium.
I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know
what to do. I had to think fast.
Suddenly I remembered that poster I
saw on the wall of Mrs. Cooney’s office.
The one with the cartoon of a kid choking.
“Quick!” I said. “Somebody punch
Andrea in the stomach!”
“Are you crazy?” Michael said. “We’ll
get in trouble!”
“If you punch her in the stomach, the
apple will come out!” I shouted.
“I had to stay after school the time I
shot spitballs at her,” Ryan said. “I’m not
punching her in the stomach.”
“It was your idea, A.J.,” said Michael.
“You punch her in the stomach.”
I always wanted to punch Andrea,
come to think of it. I grabbed her from
behind like the guy did in the poster.
Then I rammed both of my fists against
her stomach.
The chunk of apple shot out of
Andrea’s mouth and bounced off Ryan’s
head.
Andrea started to breathe again.
“A.J., you saved my life!” she said. Then
she gave me a hug.
“Oooh!” Ryan said. “A.J. and Andrea are
in love!”
Emily came running into the vomitorium with Mrs. Cooney, who was carrying
her first-aid kit.
“What happened?” shouted Mrs.
Cooney. “Are you okay, Andrea?”
“I am now,” Andrea
said. “I had a piece of
apple caught in my
throat, but A.J. knew
what to do. He probably saved my life.”
“Wow!” said Mrs.
Cooney. “You’re a
real hero, A.J.!”
“It was nothing,
really,” I said.
Then Mrs. Cooney
gave me a hug.
“Oooh!” Ryan said. “A.J. and Mrs.
Cooney are in love!”
“Shut up!” I told Ryan.

Chapter Eleven
The Stakeout
“Meet me by the monkey bars at three
o’clock,” Andrea whispered as she passed
my desk. “I’ve got a plan.”
When I got to the playground after
school, Ryan and Michael were there. So
were Andrea and Emily. Andrea looked
around to make sure nobody else could
hear us.
“I overheard Mrs. Cooney talking to
Principal Klutz,” Andrea said. “She’s going
to be in her office at seven o’clock
tonight.”
“So what?” Ryan asked.
“So we can catch her in the act, dumbhead!” Andrea said.
“We can peek in the window of the
nurse’s office,” said Emily.
“I’ll bring my camera,” Michael said.
“We can use the pictures as evidence.”
“Smart thinking,” said Andrea.
It sounded like a good idea. But there
was one problem. Even though I only live
a block from school, my mom wasn’t
going to let me go out by myself at night.
I didn’t want to tell everybody that,
because I didn’t want them calling me a
baby.
When I got home, I told my mom that,
oh, by the way, I have to go over to
school after dinner.
“What for?” my mom asked.
“It’s a secret,” I said. “We’re making
presents for Mother’s Day.”
I don’t usually like to lie. But my
mother once told me that sometimes it’s
okay to lie. Like when your grandma
gives you a present, you have to say you
like it no matter how horrible and disgusting it is.
The fate of the world was on my shoulders. I figured this was one of those
times it was okay to lie.
“Mother’s Day, eh?” said Mom, all
smiles. “Okay. But you be careful crossing
the street.”
It was drizzling a little when I got to
school. It didn’t look like anyone else was
around. But then I heard somebody call
out, “In here!”
I looked in the bushes under Mrs.
Cooney’s window. Michael and Ryan and
Andrea and Emily were huddled in there.
“Shh!” Andrea said. “Mrs. Cooney isn’t
here yet.”
“We should synchronize our watches,”
Ryan said.
“What does that mean?” asked Emily.
“How should I know?” Ryan said. “But
they always do that in the movies.”
None of us had watches, but it didn’t
matter because at that very instant a car
came around the corner and pulled up to
the curb in front of the school.
“Wow, a Jaguar!” said Michael, who
knows a lot about cars.
“Spies always drive cool cars,” said
Ryan.
The car stopped and somebody got
out.
“Look, it’s her!” we all said. “It’s Mrs.
Cooney!”
“And she’s wearing a trench coat!” Ryan
said. “Spies always wear trench coats.”
“Maybe she’s wearing a trench coat
because it’s raining,” I said.
“She’s got a briefcase, too,” Ryan said.
“Spies always carry briefcases.”
Mrs. Cooney walked around to the
front door of the school. It wasn’t long
until the light went on in the nurse’s
office over our heads.
The window was a little too high for us
to look inside. Michael and Ryan got
down on their hands and knees, and I
climbed up on their backs. I was holding
on to the windowsill with my hands. I
could just barely see when I stood on my
tiptoes.
“Do you see anything?” Emily asked.
“Mrs. Cooney is looking in her file cabinet,” I said.
“Spies are always looking in file cabinets,” Ryan said. “That’s where they store
their secret information.”
“A.J.,” Michael said, “your foot is tickling my back!”
“What do you want me to do?” I asked.
I had one foot on Ryan’s back and the
other foot on Michael’s back. But Michael
was wriggling around. It was hard to
stand.
“Move your foot a little to the left,”
Michael said.
So I did. But when I moved my foot to
the left, Michael moved a little to the
right. And when I put my foot down on
his back, his back wasn’t there anymore.
Nothing was there anymore.
My hand slipped off the wet windowsill. And the next thing I knew, I was
flat on my back on the ground.
“Ow!” I screamed. “My elbow is broken!
I think I’m going to die!”
“Shh!” Andrea said. “Mrs. Cooney will
hear you!”
She must have heard me, because
about a second later the window opened.
Mrs. Cooney poked her head out.
“What’s going on down there?” Mrs.
Cooney asked.
“We, uh, lost our ball,” Michael said.
“We were playing with it and it must
have rolled under this bush.”
“A.J.,” said Mrs. Cooney. “Why are you
lying on the ground?”
“I’m, uh, relaxing,” I explained.
“There’s blood on your elbow,” Mrs.
Cooney said.
“I’ll wash it off when I get home,” I said.
“Nothing doing,” said Mrs. Cooney. “I’ll
be out in a minute and clean you up.
You’re under my supervision now.”
“Did you hear that?” I said. “Mrs.
Cooney has super vision!”
“That means she can see through
walls!” Ryan said.
“Wow!” Michael said. “She’s not only a
spy, but she’s got super powers, too!”
That was the last straw, as they say. I
decided right then and there that I could
not marry Mrs. Cooney no matter what.
Mrs. Cooney came running over with
her first-aid kit.
“What are you kids doing here at this
hour?” she asked as she started cleaning
the blood off my elbow with a cloth.
“We might ask you the same question,
Mrs. Cooney,” I said, “or whatever your
real name is.”
“What are you talking about?” she
asked. “I had some work to do. So many
kids have been sick lately, I haven’t been
able to get my work done during the day.”
“Spy work, no doubt,” Andrea said.
“What?” asked Mrs. Cooney as she
sprayed some stinging stuff on my elbow.
“Don’t play dumb,” I said. “We caught
you, like a rat in a trap! Oh, you had us
fooled for a while. But we were just too
smart for you.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking
about,” said Mrs. Cooney.
“That’s what they all say,” I said. “Tell it
to the police.”
“You kids are crazy,” Mrs. Cooney said.
“Do your parents know you’re here?”
“Don’t change the subject,” I said.
“You’re a spy and you’re going to sell our
secrets to some evil guy who wants to
take over the world!”
“Are you out of your minds?” asked
Mrs. Cooney. “I had to work late.”
“You’ll have plenty of time to work late
where you’re going, Mrs. Cooney,” I said.
“They’re gonna throw you in the slammer.”
“What’s a slammer?” asked Ryan.
“How should I know?” I said. “But that’s
where they throw spies after they catch
them.”
Mrs. Cooney finished cleaning off the
cut on my elbow. She put a Sesame Street
Band-Aid on it.
“Okay, okay,” she said. “I admit it.
You’re right. It’s all true. I am a spy. Now
let’s go home.”

Chapter Twelve
Good-bye to Mrs. Cooney
Mrs. Cooney promised that she would
turn herself in to the police if we let her
drive us home. First she dropped off
Emily at her house. Next she dropped off
Andrea at her house. Then she dropped
off Michael at his house. Then she
dropped off Ryan at his house. And
finally she pulled up to my house.
Mrs. Cooney put on the emergency
brake and turned to face me. She put her
hand on my shoulder. I knew what was
going to happen next.
She was going to try and kiss me!
That’s what always happens in the
movies, right? Every time a boy and a girl
are alone in a car at night, they start kissing. It happens every time.
Yuck! I didn’t care how beautiful Mrs.
Cooney was. I didn’t care how much Mrs.
Cooney’s eyes looked like cotton candy.
No way I was going to kiss her. Kissing is
disgusting!
“Mrs. Cooney,” I said, “there’s something we need to talk about.”
“What is it?” she asked.
“I can’t marry you,” I said.
“Huh?” she said. “But—”
“Please, don’t beg,” I said. “I had to
choose between love and country. It was
the hardest decision I ever had to make.
But I decided that I can’t betray my country to marry a spy and a traitor.”
Mrs. Cooney stared at me for a while,
like she didn’t know what to say. Then
she looked all sad. I thought she might
even cry.
“A.J.,” she said. “I
understand. I’ll survive . . . somehow.”
She gave me a
hug, and I got out of
the car.
The future is
going to be hard for
both of us. Mrs.
Cooney may have to
spend the rest of her
life in jail for what
she did. And me,
well, somehow I’ll have to get on with my
life without her. I think we can both do it.
But it won’t be easy!
