“My name is A.J. I like football and video
games, and I hate school.” Our teacher,
Miss Daisy, was taking attendance. It was
the first day of second grade. Miss Daisy
told everyone in the class to stand up,
say our name, and say something about
ourself.
1
I Hate School!
1
2
All the kids laughed when I said I
hated school. But there was nothing
funny about it. I have learned a lot in my
eight years. One thing I learned is that
there is no reason why kids should have
to go to school.
If you ask me, kids can learn all we
need to learn by watching TV. You can
learn important information like which
breakfast cereal tastes best and what toys
you should buy and which shampoo
leaves your hair the shiniest. This is stuff
that we’ll need to know when we grow
up.
School is just this dumb thing that
grown-ups thought up so they wouldn’t
have to pay for baby-sitters. When I grow
up and have children of my own, I won’t
make them go to school. They can just
ride their bikes and play football and
video games all day. They’ll be happy,
and they’ll think I’m the greatest father
in the world.
But for now, I wanted to let my new
teacher, Miss Daisy, know from the very
start how I felt about school.
“You know what, A.J.?” Miss Daisy said,
“I hate school too.”
“You do?”
We all stared at Miss Daisy. I thought
teachers loved school. If they didn’t love
school, why did they become teachers?
3

Why would they ever want to go to a
school as a grown-up? I know that when
I’m a grown-up, I’m not going to go anywhere near a school.
“Sure I hate school,” Miss Daisy continued. “If I didn’t have to be here teaching
you, I could be home sitting on my comfortable couch, watching TV and eating
bonbons.”
“Wow!” we all said.
“What’s a bonbon?” asked Ryan, a kid
with black sneakers who was sitting next
to me.
“Bonbons are these wonderful chocolate treats,” Miss Daisy told us. “They’re
about the size of a large acorn, and you
can pop the whole thing right in your
mouth so you don’t need a napkin. I
could eat a whole box of bonbons in one
sitting.”
6
“They sound delicious!” said Andrea
Young, a girl with curly brown hair. She
was sitting up real straight in the front of
the class with her hands folded like they
were attached to each other.
Miss Daisy seemed like a pretty cool
lady, for a teacher. Anybody who hated
school and liked to sit around watching
TV and eating chocolate treats was okay
by me.
Me and Miss Daisy had a lot in
common. Maybe going to school wouldn’t be so terrible after all.

Miss Daisy said it was time for us to clear
off our desks and see how much we knew
about arithmetic.
Ugh!
“If I gave you fifty-eight apples and
Principal Klutz took twenty-eight of
them away,” Miss Daisy asked, “how
many apples would you have left? A.J.?”
Principal Klutz
and
Miss Daisy
Dumb
“Who cares how many apples you
would have left?” I said. “I hate apples. If
you ask me, you and Principal Klutz can
take all the apples away and it wouldn’t
bother me one bit.”
“You would have thirty apples,” said
that girl Andrea Young in the front of the
class. She had a big smile on her face, like
she had just opened all her birthday presents. Andrea Young thinks she’s so smart.
“I hate arithmetic,” I announced.
“You know what?” Miss Daisy said. “I
hate arithmetic too!”
“You do?” we all said.
“Sure! I don’t even know
what you get if you multi-
8
ply four times
four.”
“You don’t?”
“I have no idea,”
Miss Daisy said,
scratching her head and
wrinkling up her forehead like she was
trying to figure it out. “Maybe one of you
kids can explain it to me?”
Boy, Miss Daisy was really dumb! Even
9
10
I know what you get when you multiply
four times four. But that smarty-pants-Iknow-everything-girl Andrea Young beat
me to it and got called on first.
“If you put four crayons in a row,” she
told Miss Daisy as she put a bunch of
crayons on the top of her desk, “and you
make four rows of four crayons, you’ll have
sixteen crayons. See?” Then she counted
the crayons from one to
sixteen.
Miss Daisy
looked at the
crayons on Andrea’s
desk. She had a puzzled look on her
11
face.
“I’m not sure I understand,” she said.
“Can somebody else explain it to me?”
Michael Robinson, this kid wearing a
red T-shirt with a dirt bike on it, explained
four times four again, using pencils. He
had sixteen pencils on his desk, in four
rows of four pencils. Miss Daisy still had a
look on her face like she didn’t understand.
“What would happen if you subtracted
half of the pencils?” she asked.
Michael took away two of the rows
of pencils and put them in his pencil
box.
“Then you would have eight pencils!”
12
we all said.
Andrea Young added, “Half of sixteen
is eight.”
Miss Daisy wrinkled up her forehead
until it was almost like an accordion. She
still didn’t get it!
She started counting the pencils on
Michael’s desk out loud and using her
fingers. She got it all wrong. We gathered
around Michael’s desk and tried to
explain to Miss Daisy how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers using
the pencils.
Nothing worked. Miss Daisy had to be
the dumbest teacher in the history of the
world! No matter how many times we
tried to explain, she kept shaking her
head.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “It will take me a
while to understand arithmetic. Maybe
you can explain it to me more tomorrow.
For now we have to clean off our desks
because Principal Klutz is going to come
in and talk to us.”
I know all about principals. My friend
Billy from around the corner, who was in
second grade last year, told me that the
principal is like the king of the school. He
runs everything.
Billy says that if you break the rules,
you have to go to the principal’s office,
which is in a dungeon down in the
13
14
basement. Kids in the dungeon get
locked up and are forced to listen to
their parents’ old CDs for hours. It must
be horrible.
Miss Daisy told us to be on our best
behavior so Principal Klutz would see
how mature we were. Finally he walked
into our room.
“Welcome to the second grade,” he said
cheerfully. “I’m sure we are all going to
have a wonderful year together.”
Principal Klutz said a lot of stuff about
the rules of the school. We’re not allowed
to run in the halls, and we’re not allowed
to chew gum. Stuff like that.
But I wasn’t listening very closely
because I kept staring at his head. He had
no hair at all! I mean none! His head
looked like a giant egg.
When Principal Klutz was all done
telling us the rules of the school, he
asked if anybody had any questions
about what he had said.
“Did all your hair fall out of your
head,” I asked, “or did you cut it off?”
Everybody laughed, even though I didn’t
say anything funny. Miss Daisy looked at
me with a mean face.
“Actually, it was both,” Principal Klutz
replied with a chuckle. “Almost all of my
hair fell out on its own, so I decided to
shave the rest of it off.”
“That’s the saddest story I ever heard!”
said this girl named Emily, and she burst
into tears.
“Don’t feel bad,” Principal Klutz said. “It
could have been a lot worse.”
“How?” sniffled Emily.
“Well, at least my brain didn’t fall out of
my head!”
We all laughed, even Emily. Principal
Klutz was a pretty funny guy, for a principal.
“Any other questions?”
“Do you have a dungeon down in the
16
basement where you put the bad kids?” I
asked.
“Actually, the dungeon is on the third
floor,” Principal Klutz replied.
Nobody laughed this time. He quickly
told us that he was just making a joke
and that he didn’t even have a dungeon
at all.
Principal Klutz must have felt bad that
we didn’t think his joke was funny,
because he invited us all up to the front
of the room to touch his bald head.
We did, and that made everybody feel
a lot better.
Principal Klutz seemed nice, but a lot
of people seem nice when you first
17
18
meet them. Then later you find out that
they are evil villains who plan to take
over the world.
I bet he was lying about the dungeon.
19
Before school started, my mother told
me that second grade was the most
interesting grade because this was the
year that I would be able to read chapter books all by myself. I already knew
how to read, even though I had tried
very hard not to learn.
20

How to
Spell Read
You see, my friend Billy told me that
you really don’t have to know how to
read. Billy says that when you grow up
and make lots of money, you can pay
people to read for you. That sounded
good to me.
“I hate reading,” I announced when
Miss Daisy passed out some spelling
worksheets.
“Me too!” agreed Miss Daisy.
“You do?” we all asked.
“Yup,” she said. “I can’t read a word.”
“You can’t?”
“Nope.”
“You can’t even spell the word read?”
Michael Robinson asked.
21
“I don’t have a clue,” she said, scratching her head the same way she did when
she told us she didn’t know how to multiply four times four.
“Just sound it out, Miss Daisy!” Andrea
suggested.
“R-e-e-d?” Miss Daisy said.
“No!” we all shouted.
“I give up,” she said. “Do any of you
know how to spell the word read?”
“R-e-a-d,” we all chanted.
“Wow! I didn’t know that!” marveled
Miss Daisy. “You have taught me a lot
today.”
“How did you get to teach second
grade if you don’t even know how to
spell read?” asked Ryan.
“Well, I figured that second graders
don’t know how to spell very well, so it
wouldn’t matter whether or not I could
spell.”
“I know how to spell lots of hard
words,” Andrea Young announced.
“Me too,” everybody else said.
23
“Really?” Miss Daisy said. “Like what?”
Everybody started shouting out words
and how to spell them, but Miss Daisy
stopped us and made us take turns. She
had each of us go up to the chalkboard
and write three words we knew.
I wrote tonight, writing, and
McDonald’s.
By the time we were done, the whole
chalkboard was filled with words. There
wasn’t even any room left for more.
“Wow!” Miss Daisy said. “You kids have
taught me so much this morning. I’m
really glad I decided to become a teacher.”
24
In the lunchroom I opened my lunchbox
and saw that my mom had packed me a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I traded
it with Michael Robinson for his potato
chips. Everybody was talking about Miss
Daisy.
“Miss Daisy is crazy,” Ryan said.
25
1
Miss Daisy
Is Crazy!
4
26
“She’s the weirdest teacher I ever had,”
said Emily. “She can’t read, she can’t
write, and she can’t even do arithmetic.
What kind of a teacher is
that?”
“A bad one,” I said.
“Hey, I just thought of something,”
Michael Robinson was able to say even
though his mouth was filled with peanut
butter. “Do you think that maybe Miss
Daisy isn’t really a teacher at all?”
“What do you mean?” Ryan asked.
27
28
“Maybe she’s an impostor,” said
Andrea.
“An impostor? What’s that?” I asked.
“Somebody who imposts?”
“No, silly. An impostor is somebody
who pretends to be somebody else,”
Andrea explained. “She might be a fake
teacher.”
“Maybe Miss Daisy is really a jewel
thief or a bank robber,” I guessed. “Maybe
she snuck into the school and is hiding
so the police won’t catch her.”
“I think you’re the one who’s crazy.”
Andrea giggled, choking on her milk.
But what if Miss Daisy was a bank
robber? Or she could be a horse thief or a
cattle rustler or somebody who parks
where there is a yellow line on the curb.
My head was starting to fill with all kinds
of awful things Miss Daisy could be.
“Maybe Miss Daisy kidnapped our real
teacher and is holding her for ransom!” I
suggested.
“Wow, you think so?” Emily asked,
looking all scared.
“What’s ransom?” asked Ryan.
“My mom tells me I’m handsome,”
Michael Robinson claimed.
“Not handsome! Ransom!” said Andrea.
“I don’t know what it is, but whenever
somebody is kidnapped, they get held for
it.”
29
“In cartoons people who get kidnapped
are always tied up to railroad tracks,” I
reminded everybody. “Maybe our real
teacher is tied up to some railroad tracks
right now!”
“We’ve got to save her!” said Emily, and
she went running out of the lunchroom.
“Wait a minute,” said Michael Robinson.
“That doesn’t make sense. If Miss Daisy
can’t even read or do arithmetic, how is
she going to be able to kidnap a teacher
and tie her to railroad tracks?”
“She doesn’t look like a kidnapper to
me,” Ryan said.
“We should tell Principal Klutz,” said
Andrea. “He’ll know what to do.”
“No!” I shouted. “Don’t you see how
good we have it? If we tell Principal Klutz
how dumb Miss Daisy is, he will fire her
and replace her with a real teacher. A real
teacher who knows reading and writing
and arithmetic. We’ll have to learn all
that stuff. You don’t want that, do you?”
“No way!” said Michael Robinson.
“I don’t care if she is an impostor or a
bank robber or a kidnapper,” I said. “I
31
32
like her. I say we keep her.”
“Me too,” Michael Robinson agreed. “I
think she’s cool.”
“Okay, let’s not tell anybody,” I said. “It
will be our little secret.”
We all agreed. Our lips would be
sealed. But not sealed with glue or anything. That would be gross.
After lunch we had recess, which means
we get to go out in the playground and
run around. Miss Daisy said we needed to
burn off energy.
“Now this is more my style,” I
announced when we got outside. I made
a beeline for the monkey bars. Then
33
5
The Most
Genius Idea!
34
me and some
other kids
hit the
swings.
After that
all the boys
had a contest
to see who could
spin around in circles the longest without
throwing up. Michael Robinson won.
Then we all sat down on the grass.
Even though Miss Daisy was pretty
cool, we all agreed that we hated
school. We made a promise to one
another that we would hate school forever, even if we changed our minds and
decided that we liked school.
That’s when Ryan came up with the
most genius idea in the history of
the world.
This was his idea: We should buy the
school.
Ryan told us that his father worked for
this big company and that once his father’s
company bought some other company just
like you would go into a store and buy a
candy bar. Ryan said it happens all the
time. He said he didn’t see any reason why
we couldn’t buy the school just like that.
“If we bought the school, what would
we do with it?” Michael Robinson asked.
“We could do anything we want with it.
We’d own it.”
“Could we turn it into a video-game
35
arcade?” I asked.
“Sure, why not? Instead of teaching
reading and writing and arithmetic, we
could teach kids how to play video games.”
“And we could ride skateboards in the
hallways?” asked Michael Robinson.
“Sure we could,” Ryan said, “if we
owned it.”
I got all excited, because if there’s one
thing that I like to do almost as much as
playing football, it’s playing video games.
Oh, and riding skateboards. I started
emptying out my pockets. I had a nickel,
three pennies, and a LifeSaver. The other
boys emptied their pockets too. We separated all the pennies, nickels, and dimes
into little piles. Then we added up all the
money. We had one dollar and thirty-two
cents.
“Wow!” Michael Robinson said. “That’s
a lot of money!”
“I don’t think it’s enough to buy a
school,” said Ryan, who knew a thing or
two about financial matters because his
father worked for this big company.
“Well, how much do you need to buy a
school?” I asked.
37
38
“Beats me,” said Ryan. “We’d better ask
Miss Daisy.”
We all rushed inside after recess and
asked Miss Daisy how much it would cost
to buy the school.
“Gee, I don’t know,” said Miss Daisy, who
didn’t seem to know much of anything.
“Why do you want to buy the school?”
“We want to turn it into a video-game
arcade,” I told her.
“What a great idea!” She beamed. “I
love video games. There are so many
schools and so few video-game arcades. It
makes perfect sense to turn some of
those schools into video-game arcades.
I’ll arrange a meeting with Mr. Klutz
tomorrow so we can ask him if we can
buy the school. But right now, we have to
go to Mrs. Cooney’s office.”
Mrs. Cooney’s office is down the hall
from our class. She says she’s the school
nurse, but personally I think she’s a spy.
I’ll tell you why. There’s this big poster on
her wall that says this:
40
I tried to read it, and it didn’t make any
sense at all. Even Andrea Young didn’t
know how to read the poster, and she
knows everything. I think Mrs. Cooney
has created a secret code, and she’s using
the poster to send mystery spy messages.
I will have to keep an eye on her.
When we walked into Mrs. Cooney’s
office, she had us all line up in size order.
I was one of the shortest kids, so I had to
stand in the front of the line. Then Mrs.
Cooney told us to take off our shoes. At
first I thought she didn’t want us to track
mud all over her office. But then she told
us that she was going to weigh and measure us. Obviously she is trying to gather
information about us, because that is
what spies do.
My friend Billy says that the heavier
you are, the smarter you are, because
heavy people have bigger brains. But I
think Billy just says that because he is
overweight. I weighed fifty-two pounds.
Mrs. Cooney showed us this awesome
ruler she has. It is made of metal and
stretches out six feet long. When she
presses a button, the whole thing shoots
into her hand and disappears like magic.
That is cool! I’ll bet she has lots of other
spy tools too.
She wouldn’t let us play with her magic
ruler, but Mrs. Cooney ran around
41
measuring everything. She showed us that
the bench we were sitting on was seventeen inches high. The door to her office
was thirty inches across. And her foot was
twelve inches long.
“Hey, my foot is a foot!” Mrs. Cooney
exclaimed.
“Aren’t all feet feet?” I asked.
“Some feet are less than a foot, and
some feet are more than a foot,” she
replied. “But my foot is
exactly a foot.”
I had no
idea
what she was
talking about.
Mrs. Cooney
wrapped the measuring tape around
her forehead and
announced, “Look!
My head is almost two feet in circumference!”
I knew that circumference was the distance all the way around a circle and
diameter was the distance through the
middle of a circle.
43
44
“What’s the diameter of your head, Mrs.
Cooney?” I asked. Everybody laughed,
even though I didn’t say anything funny.
“That would be hard to measure. But
isn’t measuring things fun?” Mrs. Cooney
asked. “I wonder how much the scale
weighs.”
Mrs. Cooney started to measure and
weigh more things, but Miss Daisy said
we had to go back to class.
At the end of the day, Miss Daisy sat on
the floor and we all sat around her. She
told us to talk about what we want to be
when we grow up.
“I want to be a veterinarian,” said Andrea
Young.
“Does anyone know what the word
45
6
What Do You
Want to Be?
46
veterinarian means?” asked Miss Daisy.
“That’s somebody who doesn’t eat
meat,” said Michael Robinson.
“It is not!” I said. “That’s a vegetarian. A
veterinarian is somebody who fought in
a war.”
“That’s a veteran,” Miss Daisy said.
“Andrea, would you like to tell the class
what a veterinarian does?”
“A veterinarian is an animal doctor.”
That Andrea Young thinks she knows
everything. But for once, I knew she was
wrong.
“Animals can’t be doctors,” I said.
Everybody laughed, even though I
didn’t say anything funny. Miss Daisy
said a veterinarian is a doctor who takes
care of animals. That made a lot more
sense than that dumb thing Andrea said.
Emily was next and she said she
wanted to grow up and become a nurse
in a hospital.
“Why do you want to do that?” I asked.
“People come into hospitals all sick and
injured, their arms falling off, their guts
hanging out. . . .”
“A.J.!” Miss Daisy said in her serious
voice.
Emily got all upset and ran out of the
room crying.
“What did I say?” I asked.
“What do you want to be when you
grow up, A.J.?” Miss Daisy asked.
“I’m going to be a famous football
47
player,” I said.
“Really? And why did you choose that
field?”
“Because I love football,” I said, “and if I
was a football player, I wouldn’t have to
read or write or do arithmetic or go to
school. My friend Billy told me that foot-
49
ball players are really dumb.”
“Your friend told you that?” said Miss
Daisy.
“Yeah, Billy is really smart. He also told
me that if you dig a hole deep enough,
you can dig all the way to China. And if
you fall into that hole, you’d fall all the
way through the Earth and pop right out
the other side. And you’d be moving so
fast that you’d shoot all the way into
outer space.”
Michael Robinson said that sounded
cool. He decided that instead of becoming a firefighter, he wanted to become
one of those hole-digging astronauts.
Emily came back into the room with
50
a tissue. Everybody else went around in a
circle saying what they wanted to be.
This girl named Lindsay said she wanted
to be a singer. Ryan said he wanted to be
a businessman like his dad.
Andrea Young said that if she couldn’t
be a veterinarian, she wanted to be a
teacher like Miss Daisy. Then she gave
Miss Daisy a big smile.
I hate her.
The next day, Miss Daisy brought in a
box with ribbons on it and told us she
had a surprise.
“What’s in the box?” we pleaded.
“It’s a secret.”
“Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease?”
“Well, okay,” she said, opening the box.
51
7
Bonbons and
Footballs
52
“It’s bonbons!”
Miss Daisy said she thought we might
be able to use them for arithmetic problems so we could learn together. She put
the bonbons on the table in the front of
the room. There must have been twenty
or thirty of them. “Can somebody think
up an arithmetic problem using bonbons?” she asked. “Andrea?”
“If you had three bonbons in a box,”
said Andrea as she put three bonbons
into her pencil box, “and you had three
boxes just like that, how many bonbons
would you have all together?”
Miss Daisy looked at Andrea’s pencil
box for a long time, counting in her head
and on her fingers. Any dummy would
know that three boxes with three bonbons in each box would equal nine bonbons. Three times three is nine. But Miss
Daisy didn’t seem to know that. Finally
she just opened up Andrea’s pencil box
53
54
and popped the three bonbons into her
mouth.
“Who cares how many bonbons I
would have?” she asked. “As long as I get
to eat some of them!”
Miss Daisy really needs a lot of help
with arithmetic.
After she had eaten her bonbons, Miss
Daisy passed out bonbons for all of us
and we had a bonbon party. Then she
said that was enough arithmetic for the
day and asked what we wanted to talk
about for the rest of our math time.
“Football!” I shouted.
Miss Daisy didn’t like that I talked
without raising my hand first. Personally,
I don’t see what raising my hand has to
do with talking. I don’t talk with my
hands.
But she did let me talk, and I told her
that football is just about my favoritest
thing in the world and I know all about it.
My dad takes me to every game of the
Chargers, a professional football team.
“Maybe you can help me,” Miss Daisy
said. “I always wondered how long is a
football field?”
“A hundred yards,” I told her. “Anybody
knows that.”
“Wow! That’s a big field. With a field
that big, how can you and your father see
what’s going on?”
“My dad always tries to get us seats
near the fifty-yard line,” I said. “They’re
55
56
the best tickets.”
“Why?” Miss Daisy asked.
“Because the fifty-yard line is right in
the middle of the field.”
“Does that mean that half of a hundred
yards would be fifty yards?” she asked.
“Yup.”
“I see,” Miss Daisy said. “So if you know
there are a hundred yards on a football
field, do you know how many pennies
there are in a dollar? Andrea?”
“A hundred!” hollered Andrea Young.
“Just like a football field!”
“Really?” said Miss Daisy. “So if half the
football field is fifty yards, how many
pennies are in half a dollar?”
“Fifty!” Michael Robinson shouted.
“Because fifty is half of a hundred and
fifty plus fifty makes a hundred!”
“And half of fifty must be twenty-five
because two quarters is fifty cents!”
added Emily.
“And four quarters makes a dollar!”
Ryan exclaimed.
“And four quarters makes a football
game, too!” Miss Daisy shouted, jumping
58
up and down with excitement.
“Wait a minute,” I said. “I thought you
told us we were finished with arithmetic.”
“This wasn’t arithmetic,” she told us. “It
was football.”
“Well, okay,” I said. “Just as long as you
weren’t trying to sneak arithmetic into
our conversation about football.”
“Would I do that?” Miss Daisy asked,
and then she winked at me.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell if Miss Daisy
is serious or not.
On Thursday Principal Klutz came into
our class. He was wearing a hat, which
almost made him look like a regular
person who had hair on his head.
“I have to go to a meeting,” Principal
Klutz told us, “but I heard that some of
you second graders had something important you wanted to discuss with me.”
59
8
A Lot
of Books!
60
Miss Daisy said that I could ask my
question.
“Can we buy the school?”
“Hmmm,” Principal Klutz said. “Hmmm”
is what grown-ups say instead of “er” or
“um” or “uh” when they don’t know what
to say.
“Why do you want to buy the school?”
Principal Klutz asked.
“Because we want to turn it into a
video-game arcade,” I told him.
“I see,” the principal said. “Schools cost
a lot of money.”
“How much?” I asked. “If you tell us how
much it will cost, we’ll raise the money.”
“I’ll tell you what,” Principal Klutz said.
“I can’t sell you the school, but I can rent
it to you for a night. Do you know the difference between buying and renting?”
Andrea Young got her hand up first, as
usual.
“When you buy a video, you get to
keep it forever,” she said. “If you rent it,
you have to return it to the video store in
a couple of days.”
61
62
“That’s right,” the principal said. “Would
you be interested in renting the school for
a night?”
“How much would that cost?” I asked.
“One million pages,” Principal Klutz
replied.
“Huh?”
“If you kids read a million pages in
books, you can turn the school into a
video-game arcade for one night.”
A million pages! That sounded like a
lot of books.
“How about a thousand pages?” I suggested.
“A million,” said Principal Klutz. “That’s
my final offer. Take it or leave it.”
“Would it be okay if some of the other
classes helped us out?” Miss Daisy asked.
“Certainly,” Principal Klutz said. “The
more the merrier. And I’ll tell you what
I’m going to do. If the kids in this school
read a million pages, I will come to the
big video-game night dressed in a gorilla
suit.”
“You’ve got a deal!” I said, rushing forward to shake Principal Klutz’s hand.
In my head I was already hatching a
plan.
As soon as I got home from school, I went
up to my big sister Amy’s room.
Amy is in fifth grade, so she knows lots
of things.
“You’ve got to help me!” I said. “If the
school reads a million pages in books,
Principal Klutz will put on a gorilla suit
64
Put Those
Books Away

and let us turn the school into a videogame arcade!”
“I would do anything to see that,” Amy
said.
Amy knows how to work the computer
really well. She helped me make posters
that said LET’S TURN OUR SCHOOL INTO A
VIDEO-GAME ARCADE! and LET’S TURN PRINCIPAL KLUTZ INTO A GORILLA!
66
We tacked the posters up all over Main
Street. Amy sent e-mails and instant messages to all the kids in the fifth grade. The
next morning we tacked the posters up
all over school. I passed them out to the
kids I saw. Mrs. Roopy, the school librarian, said we could put up some posters in
the library. Mr. Sacco, the custodian, said
we could put some up in the lunchroom
and the bathrooms. Ms. Hynde, the
music teacher, said we could put some up
in the music room.
By the middle of the day, everyone in
the school was reading like crazy! Kids
were reading during lunch. Kids were
reading during recess! Kids were plowing
67
their way through books and then running to the school library to ask Mrs.
Roopy if they could check out more. I
read a book about frogs, and I don’t even
care anything about frogs.
Some of the teachers were starting to
get mad, because kids were reading
books when they were supposed to be
doing other things.
“Please put those books away,” Miss
Daisy had to tell us. “It’s time for reading.”
Miss Daisy said she was sorry that she
wouldn’t be able to help us very much
because she didn’t know how to read. But
she was nice enough to draw a big mural
in the hallway with a giant thermometer
on it. Every time we read a lot of pages,
she would make the temperature line on
the thermometer go up. At the top of the
thermometer were the words One million.
Soon kids were bursting into our room
and yelling, “Mrs. Biggs’s class has read
another five hundred pages!” and “Miss
Hasenfratz says to
add another six
hundred pages!” It
was fun watching
the temperature
go up.
At the end of a
week, our school
had read almost
a half a million
pages!

“Boys and girls, today we have a very special and famous guest,” Miss Daisy said.
“His name is Boomer Wiggins.”
“Wow!” was the first thing everybody
said.
“Who’s he?” was the second thing
everybody said.

Football Players
Are
Really Dumb
But I knew who Boomer Wiggins was.
Because Boomer Wiggins was my hero. He
was the quarterback of my favorite football team, the Chargers! Wow! A real football player right in our classroom! Miss
Daisy told us that Boomer Wiggins had a
daughter in fourth grade, and that’s why
he was spending the day at our school.
When Boomer Wiggins walked into the
class, everybody gasped. He was really
big and had so many muscles that they
poked right against his shirt! We all
crowded around him, and Boomer let us
feel his arm muscles. I couldn’t even
get my hands around them! Then
Boomer picked up Emily with one hand!
71
72
He was amazing. Then
he gave each of us
a little plastic
football, and he
signed his name on
each one.
“Does
anybody
have any
questions?”
Boomer asked.
“Do you like
knocking guys
on their butts?”
I asked.
Everybody
laughed,
even though I didn’t say anything that
was funny. Miss Daisy said it was “butt,”
not “butts,” because a person only has
one butt. But I said a butt was divided
into two halves, so really it could be
“butts.” Miss Daisy said that was enough
of that talk. I said she shouldn’t be complaining because she was the one who
started it.
“I don’t like knocking people down,”
Boomer told us, “but sometimes we have
to because it’s part of the game.”
“Mr. Wiggins,” asked Miss Daisy, “is it
true that football players are really dumb?”
We all gasped. I was afraid Boomer
Wiggins might knock Miss Daisy on her
butt.
73
74
“Excuse me?” Boomer said, like he
wasn’t sure if he had heard the question.
“Well, somebody once told me that if
you play football, you don’t have to know
how to read or write or do arithmetic or
go to school.”
“Who told you that?” Boomer asked
Miss Daisy.
Everybody looked at me. I slid down so
that my head was almost under my desk,
and I hid behind my notebook.
“Oh, a good friend of mine told me,”
Miss Daisy said. “Is it true?”
“If I didn’t go to school, I never could
have become a football player,” Boomer
told us. “I have to read and study my
playbook very carefully. I have to write
letters to my fans. Every week I have to
study very hard to get ready for the next
game.”
“Did you go to college?” asked Miss
Daisy.
“Yes,” Boomer said, “and when my football career is over, I plan to go back to
school so I can become a doctor.”
“Wow!” I said. “I want to go to college
someday so I can become a doctor and
knock guys on their butts. I mean butt.”
Everybody laughed, even though I
didn’t say anything funny. Then, to
prove how smart he was, Boomer
Wiggins read us a book and passed out
75
76
bookmarks that said “Achieve Your Goal
by Reading” on them.
Miss Daisy said that even though
Boomer read the book to us, we could
still add fifty-two pages to the total
number of pages we’ve read.
The temperature level on the thermometer in the hallway kept getting
higher and higher.
Finally the big moment arrived. It was
Andrea Young (of course!) who read the
one-millionth page. We all cheered when
Miss Daisy went out in the hallway and
filled in the top of the thermometer all
the way up to the words One million.
That Friday night, everybody in the
77

We Rule
the School!
whole school showed up at school. Can
you believe it? I actually couldn’t wait to
get to school . . . on the weekend! When
we got there, a big banner was hanging
over the front door that said WE READ A
MILLION PAGES! on it. Principal Klutz was
waiting for us. He was wearing a gorilla
suit, just like he promised. Inside there
was a table of snacks and treats and juice.
Miss Daisy had brought in bonbons.
But best of all, the gym was filled wall
to wall with video games!
80
I had never seen so many video games
in my life. Families had brought in lots of
TV sets, game systems, and games, and
lined them up all around the gym. We
could play all we wanted, and the only
rule was that you had to take turns.
For the kids who didn’t like video
games, there were tables of board games
set up in the middle of the gym. (I think
they’re called board games because you
get so bored playing them.)
I played just about every video game in
the gym. After a few hours of staring into
screens, I had a splitting headache, my
hands hurt, and I thought my eyes were
going to fall out of my head.
It was the greatest night of my life.
Monday at school, we had social studies.
Miss Daisy said she was really sorry, but
she didn’t know anything at all about
social studies and that we would have to
help her.
“I don’t even know the name of the
first president of the United States,” she
told us.

Poor
Miss Daisy

“You don’t?” we all said.
“I haven’t a clue.”
“It was George Washington!” we all
shouted.
“Really?” Miss Daisy said with a wink.
“Never heard of him.”
I was beginning to suspect that Miss
Daisy might have been just pretending
that she didn’t know anything all along.
One day I caught her looking at a piece of
paper, and her eyes were moving back
and forth like she was watching a PingPong game.
“Hey, you’re reading!” I said.
“I am not!” she insisted. “You know I
can’t read.”
“Then how come your eyes are moving
back and forth like you’re watching a
Ping-Pong game?”
“I—I was just thinking about this great
Ping-Pong game I saw once,” she replied.
“It was great. You should have been there.”
Maybe she was joking, and maybe she
wasn’t. You can never tell with Crazy
Miss Daisy.
If it turns out that Miss Daisy really
doesn’t know anything, I feel a little sorry
for her. The kids in our school had read a
million pages, and she couldn’t read one
page. The kids in our class knew how to
spell, and do arithmetic and social studies. She hardly knew anything at all!
“Don’t feel bad, Miss Daisy,” I told her.
“We’ll teach you reading, writing, and
83
arithmetic. And we won’t tell Principal
Klutz how dumb you are.” She gave me a
big hug.
It will be hard work teaching Miss
Daisy everything that she doesn’t know. I
think that by the end of the year, if the
whole class works together, we just might
bring her up to second-grade level.
But it won’t be easy.
